Within 30 minutes the tufted titmice, chickadees, nuthatches, and various sparrow species had figured it out. They are busy flitting in and out grabbing the seeds and nuts. The bar spaces on this crate are perfect size for smaller birds. Eastern Bluebirds and Carolina Wrens are also able to enter the crate. The Blue Jays, Red-bellied Woodpeckers and Mourning Doves can't enter, but there's plenty for them at the other feeders. They are larger and can muscle in with the squirrels and blackbirds. Crate was super easy to set up. No tools required, anyone can do this. Just slide it out of the box and start lifting the panels. You'll see that the main sides fold up into a rectangle. The ends then are folded up and snapped into place. Door has top and bottom latches. More than adequate to prevent squirrels from figuring out how to open the crate door. And if they do, a wire or carabineer will secure it easily. It took longer to carry the packaged crate 100 feet to the patio than to set it up. Seems well built for our purpose. Cannot attest to dog, cat, bunny, etc pet use. We have an AC cover to keep the snow/ ice off the crate (we live in upper Great Lakes). We don't expect the crate to last forever as we are leaving it outside. It looks like it will still last several years outdoors, especially if we cover it. Curious raccoons may investigate so we'll be sure to empty the pan before dark. Fortunately, no Black Bears in our area. We really like that the pan is convenient to slide in and out and it is made of a resin material. Very sturdy. We are impressed so far with the crate.

Both of the crates came in fantastic condition. They were in boxes that were dented so I was a bit worried but the crates were in perfect condition. The latches work smoothly, unlike one of the reviews stated. I have bought dozens of crates in the past because I breed a luxury type of golden retriever. With every puppy I sell I send a crate home with them. In fact I crate train my puppies before they leave. So as you can imagine getting crates inexpensively that are still quality is important to me. The picture is of a 4.5 month old golden retriever that I moved from a 30 inch crate where his head and his butt were touching both ends and he couldn\u2019t sit up straight to this 42 inch crate which should last him for life. It\u2019s gonna be a great size for him to grow into. His mom doesn\u2019t even like crates and as soon as I set this up, she went inside of it before he did which was kind of funny. I realize that doesn\u2019t really say anything about the crate but clearly she thought it was a good crate too. If you\u2019re seeing little prongs on the top of it, that\u2019s just the divider that I set on top of it. My dog is potty trained so there is no need for me to use it. One of the reviews complains that the dividers tips were metal. I have to tell you, out of all the crates I\u2019ve bought in my lifetime I\u2019ve never seen one where the divider tips weren\u2019t metal. The secret to ensuring that your dog doesn\u2019t fishhook their eyes or another part of their body on these is that once you put the dividers in you use pliers and you pinch them. This does mean that if you have to move the divider or take it out then you have to open it with the pliers again, but that\u2019s the way to safely put them in. Also, I want to tell people about a little hack that you can do with these crates, which is awesome if you need a bigger crate or want to put two dogs in a crate you can remove one of the end panels by opening up the little hooks on the bottom and then you can zip tie two different crates together at the end. This makes one long crate and it\u2019s something that I did for puppies as they were being crate trained, and were transitioning from being able to be together all the time to being alone in a crate. It works great. Doesn\u2019t permanently damage the crate you just open the hook slightly push down on the side of the door. The door comes off. You do that on both crates. You remove the doors and store them somewhere safe and then later on you can put them back on and tighten the hooks back up with pliers and it doesn\u2019t damage them. It doesn\u2019t make them weak. I did see that some of the people that left reviews got this as a free item and man I wish I would\u2019ve been here for that. But I don\u2019t mind paying what I did for it and I wouldn\u2019t mind paying a little bit more without the coupon.

Within 30 minutes the tufted titmice, chickadees, nuthatches, and various sparrow species had figured it out. They are busy flitting in and out grabbing the seeds and nuts. The bar spaces on this crate are perfect size for smaller birds. Eastern Bluebirds and Carolina Wrens are also able to enter the crate. The Blue Jays, Red-bellied Woodpeckers and Mourning Doves can't enter, but there's plenty for them at the other feeders. They are larger and can muscle in with the squirrels and blackbirds. Crate was super easy to set up. No tools required, anyone can do this. Just slide it out of the box and start lifting the panels. You'll see that the main sides fold up into a rectangle. The ends then are folded up and snapped into place. Door has top and bottom latches. More than adequate to prevent squirrels from figuring out how to open the crate door. And if they do, a wire or carabineer will secure it easily. It took longer to carry the packaged crate 100 feet to the patio than to set it up. Seems well built for our purpose. Cannot attest to dog, cat, bunny, etc pet use. We have an AC cover to keep the snow/ ice off the crate (we live in upper Great Lakes). We don't expect the crate to last forever as we are leaving it outside. It looks like it will still last several years outdoors, especially if we cover it. Curious raccoons may investigate so we'll be sure to empty the pan before dark. Fortunately, no Black Bears in our area. We really like that the pan is convenient to slide in and out and it is made of a resin material. Very sturdy. We are impressed so far with the crate.

It is his favorite place to nap", "review_comment": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this kennel for my 50-pound Australian Shepherd, who is crate-trained. I also have a 30-pound terrier mix, who is not crate-trained but still likes to wander in and stand inside sometimes. My Aussie only stays in his kennel when no one is home because he and my cat do not get along, so I wanted to upgrade his old kennel with a new one, because his old one had started to rust. Setting it up is very quick and easy I set it up by myself in under 1 minute. It just unfolds, locks into place, and it is ready to use. The metal is not as thick as his previous kennel. I noticed the side with the extra door feels a bit looser compared to the other three sides. With enough pressure on the door, it can open slightly more than expected even when locked. But, since I keep that side pushed up against the wall, it does not bother me. I also noticed the roof of it slightly caves it some. The size is perfect for medium and large dogs. My Aussie has plenty of space to sit, stand, stretch, and even lay on his back with his legs in the air, which is his signature napping position. The tray on the bottom can be locked in place but slides out easily for cleaning. The material feels a little on the cheaper side. I have had trays crack in other kennels before around the 2-year mark, so time will tell how this one holds up. It does wipe clean easily and has not absorbed any odors so far. It is not overly heavy but bulky enough that it is easier to move with two people. It does come with a handle, but I find it more comfortable to drag it when moving it myself. When folded down, it becomes surprisingly flat and portable, which is nice for travel or storage. The best part is how quickly my Aussie made it his own. As soon as I set it up, he walked right in, laid down, and took a nap. It is clearly comfortable and familiar to him, which makes me feel better. It is a good-looking, practical kennel that works well for the price.", "review_star_rating": "4", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35GBUV6VJTTZ3", "review_author_id": "AEJDF2K2FPSN6UALX2YL57TYLULA", "review_author": "Elle Zena", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJDF2K2FPSN6UALX2YL57TYLULA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": ["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71URpRt3ghL.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816IuLimiNL.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813U5hCnv9L.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uwgYhzfxL.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8149r5LZq0L.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71l3emg6xpL.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PCHESGrwL.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jPAa3JDoL.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71z-fimmmAL.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+aQno2PWL.jpg"], "review_video": {"stream_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-transcoding-artifact-us-east-1-prod/0a850bdc-7f5e-4404-ad3d-103397becbf3/embedded.cc.default.vertical.jobtemplate.hls.m3u8", "closed_captions_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-closed-captions-artifact-us-east-1-prod/closedCaptions/d5781d01-6ad3-4cdc-aa6a-ffd96f2a2afb.vtt", "thumbnail_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FdsBrJ72L._SY256.jpg"}, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "reviewed_product_asin": "B0FQ5CWNQJ", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Size": "42.13&#034;L x 26.77&#034;W x 28.74&#034;H", "Style": "Double Door"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R3TPXEOXHA9YWY", "review_title": "Good quality", "review_comment": "Bought this crate for our puppy.

For a wire cage the quality seems very good, she will jump at the door when she\u2019s excited to come out and it has held up well. If you have a dog that is completely determined to get out and they pushed with all their might they could probably bend it enough to break the door open. But so far it\u2019s held up quite will for our girl though all her jumping and pushing at the door when it\u2019s time to come out. The latches can be a pain to open and close, you have to wiggle them a lot.
