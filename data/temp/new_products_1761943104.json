The food receives positive feedback for its taste, with one customer noting the dark tender meaty morsels mixed in, and its health benefits, with one review mentioning it's super healthy for liver function. Customers report that their dogs eat it easily and without digestive issues, with many noting it works wonders for sensitive stomachs. However, some customers report that their dogs became very sick after eating it.", "top_reviews": [{"review_id": "RGJBEO6WWQ311", "review_title": "A Lifesaver for Our Allergy-Prone Pup!", "review_comment": "Purina ONE Lamb and Rice Formula has been an absolute game-changer for our rescue dog, Jake.

She was having some digestive issues with her old food and this has made a huge difference. First thing I noticed is she actually gets excited about meal time now. Before she would kind of pick at her food but with this stuff she cleans her bowl every time. The kibble size seems perfect for her too - not too big, not too small. Her stomach issues cleared up within like two weeks of switching. No more weird digestive problems or upset tummies. She seems way more comfortable after eating now. But the biggest change is her coat. It's gotten so shiny and soft since we started this food. People keep commenting on how healthy she looks. Even her energy level seems better, though that could just be because her stomach feels better. The ingredients look good too - real chicken is the first ingredient and I can actually pronounce most of the stuff on the list. No weird fillers or mystery meat byproducts. Price is reasonable for the quality. Not the cheapest dog food out there but way more affordable than some of the boutique brands that cost twice as much. The bag size lasts a good amount of time even though she's a decent sized dog with a good appetite. Easy to store and the bag seals well to keep it fresh. Only minor complaint is that it can be a little dusty when you pour it, but that's pretty typical for dry kibble. Overall really happy with this food. When you find something that works for your dog's health and they actually like eating it, you stick with it. Definitely buying again when this bag runs out. Makes me feel good knowing she's getting good nutrition without breaking the bank.", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCXYZ43SMIQED", "review_author_id": "AEFHPSFGQ7I75OADGXQ7T24E5R4A", "review_author": "jj", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEFHPSFGQ7I75OADGXQ7T24E5R4A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "reviewed_product_asin": "B009IOCCD2", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Flavor Name": "Chicken &amp; Rice", "Size": "40 Pound (Pack of 1)"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R2XMK3CAMWZUY1", "review_title": "It's what my dogs love the most", "review_comment": "I have multiple dogs in different sizes and ages.

But then all of a sudden we noticed she was having allergic reactions to the dry food we had been feeding her prior which was another weight management food by another brand. When I looked at the bag I realized they had changed their formula and did not advertise it on the bag and it contained one of the ingredients she is allergic to. I was hesitant to go back to hills science diet because she did not like it the very first time we tried it however this time she absolutely loves it. She has been high energy, enjoys the taste ( if she can even taste it she's like a Hoover) and her bowel movements are much better. Purchasing it on Amazon was much cheaper than getting it from the vet. Overall this is a quality dog food that I suggest to anyone whose dog is having health problems as Hill science diet has different types of dry food for all kinds of problems like chronic diarrhea or overall health problems and aging. The ability to start out with a 4 lb bag to see how she would handle it as opposed to a 75 lb bag from my vet is amazing.
