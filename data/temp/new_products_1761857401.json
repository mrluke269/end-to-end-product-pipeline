I've bought toys like this in the past, but the past ones were super short, far more fragile and had only 1 toy for the same price. These are sturdy, very long, have multiple toys in case one breaks or gets worn out and has a clip on the end so you can attach pretty much any cat toy you want to it. I especially love how long the wand and string is. With the short ones I've bought in the past, you have to be pretty close to your cat to play, and I don't always wanna be sitting in the floor, or sitting in a chair leaning over to be able to play with my cat. With these, I can sit back on the couch and even recline after a long day of work and still be able to play with my cat and give her the exercise she needs without tiring myself out in the process. (You can also collapse the wand if you do wanna be closer or are playing in a smaller area) I'm confident these will last a long time, especially with as many toys it comes with to clip on the end, but I will definitely be ordering more. I wanna make sure I have plenty of these around for the foreseeable future to play with my baby and be able to relax after a long day of work at the same time. The only thing I would say to be careful about is the little metal clip on the end. Sometimes my cat catches the hook and I can't pull it away from her without possibly yanking at her claw. I definitely don't wanna hurt my sweet girl, so be careful and don't yank it too hard if they catch it, but I think that applies to any toy. As long as you're not reckless and yanking really hard at the toy while they have it caught, there will be zero issues. 10/10 would recommend.", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29PDEZ69FJKCJ", "review_author_id": "AGARSEVRHQMZ7FKSGWEWDRWJSQVQ", "review_author": "Christopher G.", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGARSEVRHQMZ7FKSGWEWDRWJSQVQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "4 people found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B07F45GGPT", "reviewed_product_variant": {}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "RQK43J04IAIKZ", "review_title": "Best cat toy ever", "review_comment": "Best cat toy I\u2019ve ever purchased!

At first, like the previous reviewer mention you gotta push the balls. once the kitty gets accustomed to it after a couple of sniffs here and there, (which takes a total of 10 seconds lol) Then all hell breaks lose. I took the video about an hour ago and right now the kitty has already managed to turn it upside down and continuing to play with it in inverted-mode haha. It does have 4 rubber feet at the base so place it on something hard and it wont move around. (I just put mine on a towel for the sake of taking a video now, and it moves around when the kitty aggressively tries to maul the un-gettable balls to death) So place it on tile, wood, ceramic, anything hard that can make use of the rubber base. Moving on, the toy is wonderful. Its well-built and i tried physically asserting some force to the clip areas to test its strength and it seems sturdy enough! If i cant budge the clips with the force I used there is no way a cat can either. Its made of good quality plastic not the cheap kind you would normally expect in your head when it comes to these sorta(basically chinese made) products. It is made in China but seems to be produced and imported from the U.S.A. (I've attached a pic of it) More importantly, the kitty has been playing with it since i opened it, for an unhealthy amount of time, lol. so to make sure the kitty doesnt get bored of it, make sure you keep it stashed away somewhere for long periods and bring it out only occasionally as \"play time\" because every toy tends to get boring after a while. And you wont need to use catnip to make kitty play with things again.

It\u2019s always a gamble getting any cat toy and hoping they'll like it, so I was concerned about this one, but they\u2019ve had a similar type of toy in the past and enjoyed it. I put it away at night (because I\u2019m afraid my orange guy might chew off the string and then eat it), and I can tell both cats are waiting for me to take it out for them when I get up the next day. I love the way this toy is designed compared to similar types of toys. There are two layers of fabric with the moving parts in between, so the arm doesn't get tangled up in the fabric. The irregular pattern of the toy makes it more like a hide-and-seek game, which keeps them entertained. I appreciate that it's rechargeable, that it has multiple modes, and that I can turn off the mouse squeaking sound if I need to. All in all, this is one of the best cat toys I've found in years.

Keeps mine entertained for hours every day!", "review_comment": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that this is, hands-down, THE BEST cat toy I\u2019ve ever purchased. My cat loves playing hide and seek tag with our hands under blankets, but that can lead to some scratched skin (even though I clip her nails); so, when I saw this, I thought it might be similar, and it is! She is obsessed with it! I\u2019ve had it for about a week and she plays with it for several hours each day. I leave it on standby so she can play with it whenever she wants. I mainly work from home, so I always hear the toy turn on. What\u2019s amazing is that even with it on standby and her playing with it for hours every single day, I\u2019ve only charged it twice. I honestly can\u2019t believe how long the battery lasts. But truly, this is a wonderfully enriching toy for a cat. It engages their hunting skills, keeps them active and enthralled, and I feel like it boosts their intelligence. It\u2019s also amazing for pet owners with young cats who want to play all day. I love playing with her, but since I work from home, I have to get work done too. This allows me to do that. I\u2019m sure it would be even better for people who don\u2019t work from home and literally can\u2019t play with their cat while they work. This toy allows them to activate it whenever they want- they just touch the center part, or jiggle the \u201cmouse\u201d. So, in that way it can prevent your cat from getting bored. Lastly, if you are home to watch, it leads to many laughs. I mean, I literally sit there and watch her play. It\u2019s so amusing! I realize some cats might not respond to it as well as mine, but if your cat likes hunting, feather toys, hide n seek, or playing under the covers, I really think they will love this. A few things to mention: This has a few different modes that you shuffle through by slow pressing the power button. It goes Blue - Purple - Yellow - Off. The blue and purple modes each have 5 min continuous play until they go into standby. The yellow mode has only 30 seconds of play before going into standby. My cat, Bellatrix, mainly likes blue, and while I know blue and purple are slightly different, I don\u2019t know how to describe the difference because they are similar. I think they just have different patterns of movement, or perhaps the purple is faster. Another thing: this does have an optional audible mouse squeezing noise. Bellatrix loves it, but I don\u2019t have it on in the video because my partner is sleeping and I don\u2019t want it to wake him. So, during the day, I leave the squeak on and at night I turn it off. To turn the mouse squeak on or off, press the power button twice quickly- it will blink red when it\u2019s off and green when it\u2019s on. The power button has a silicon cover that lifts up to reveal the usb-c port. This comes with a USB-C to USB-A cord, but no charging brick. It comes with two of the same attachment- plastic rod with the green feather and the green string. I truly can\u2019t recommend this product enough. It\u2019s better than the electronic mice, the electronic balls with feathers, and it\u2019s even better than playing with a feather wand in tunnels.

Got a crazy feline who full speed runs into walls at all hours and needs at least an hour of play every day? This is amazing for that. I recently adopted my 3rd cat, and she's a tornado of a tortie. She's young, fiesty, and has seemingly endless energy. This keeps her busy for hours, I hear her rustling around with it for at least 2 hours every day. It makes me feel so much better on the busier days when I don't really have time to play with them like I would like to. I like the interactive mode the best, it allows them to come up and play whenever she wants, and then it turns off after some time. I can't lie, it's incredibly ugly and reeks of the late 2000s in terms of pattern, but I'm not buying what I think is cute, I buy what would intrigue a gremlin. It makes a good rustling noise as the fabric is like a reusable grocery bag material. It's pretty big, which also allows my other 2 cats to spectate if they wish. The battery life is very good, I haven't had to charge it since purchasing, and I appreciate how easy it is to charge it. The fake mouse squeaking does get a bit annoying, but I just move it to the other side of my house, and they can keep being annoying over there.

During each activation, a bird chirping sound will be emitted to attract cats to chase and catch, stimulating their hunting instincts", "\u3010Rechargeable\u3011The electric ball has a built-in 600mAh rechargeable battery.

All three of them have been stalking this thing since I set it to the high speed setting. It has not gotten stuck anywhere, but my kitten will pin it down and it tries to shake itself loose from her hold. It has no problem on our rugs as well as the wood floors. I would consider this an amazing value for the price. Not only does it entertain the cats but it does what I was hoping it would do: save my toes and give some peace for my older cats.", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18DR2ORB4KB4C", "review_author_id": "AHWBUX6CHNDVGA4R7VULNIXBRFXA", "review_author": "Sarah", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHWBUX6CHNDVGA4R7VULNIXBRFXA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "One person found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B0DG1X5KHM", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Color": "Orange"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R3B0MGJVHINT3H", "review_title": "It's ALIVE! LOL! Cats love it!", "review_comment": "I swear this this is ALIVE! LOL!!!! OK so yah if your cats are timid start off with the low setting. Our mother and son rescue kitties love toys but this was their first moving/noisy toy. Mama is more timid and it took a while for her to do more than just sit and watch it. The kitten and her would sit and watch it-- that was entertaining to us! We were glad that it was even holding their attention! But now the kitten chases it around and does summersaults around with it. Mama will even pick it up by its \"tail\" and has rescued it with it gets stuck. Yes it gets stuck under things. Sometimes the ball can shake itself loose and sometimes it needs help. It will roll to the same spots. I wonder if it's part Roomba how it does that. It even rolls around my feet like the kitten and seems to hide in/behind things. Its weird! Lol! I'm glad it comes with an extra tail but I wish it was stronger. The (petals/feathers?) were the first thing to fall off. The net part got a hole in it so I removed the bell before they could swallow it. The poofy balls get caught on stuff and so the tail is way stretched out. But oh well. They don't care. Hair does get stuck around where it spins and it is a bit hard to get it out from under the button area. Then I always hit the button putting the clear piece back on. Lol. When it does get lost, you can still find it if it's making noise. If the lights are off in the room you may see its occasional blinking. But I do love that it turns off until its mived again so I can leave it out. I wish we could whistle or something and have it chirp to find it easier. Or a remote. Haha. But if you forget about it, trust your cats will find it and wake you up at 5am playing with it! Lol! The cats do love it so it's definitely worth the money! Charging it is quick and convenient. I have to hide it in a drawer when I charge it, but the kitten knows exactly where it is and will sit on the drawer and paw at it. So kitty approved! Edit: As of June 2025: They wore it down already! The orange cover half came on but I used some non toxic glue to put it back on. Ordered more tails and one had to be glued at the base out of the box. Motor has slowed but they'll still watch it and sometimes attack it. They preferred the fast speed so I will have to buy a new one (or 2 lol) and retire the other.

The charge lasts for approximately 6 hours or so and it comes with a USB cable for charging. I let it loose about twice a week so they don't burnt out on it. It makes occasional chirping noises moves kinda random, and pauses for minutes at a time. It has 2 modes I think, the second being a little faster and longer bursts. It hardly ever gets stuck on anything so I rarely have to move it back into the open area. I bought the accessory pack with extra tails but have not needed it so far.

The wands are so so durable its amazing. They extend far enough that you can sit or lay down and still play with your cat. The worms always get my cat going.

When I am going out for a weekend I hang this up and it tires him out he'll play with it so much. It has lots of elastic in it to bounce around everywhere. The yellow strings are okay I put toys on the end and hooked them up to the ceiling so he can play and they didn't last very long before it started to string out.

TLDR - absolutely worth buying, great quality, great variety. You get a combination of toys where you\u2019re involved with the playing as well as independent playing for your cat. The wands- My 4 year old cat loves a good wand and his last one finally wore out (more like he ripped off all the feathers. It was a decent wand, but it didn\u2019t collapse/shrink down like these do which is so incredibly helpful. I didn\u2019t even know I needed that. If we didn\u2019t find a place to hide the old one, he would find it and drag it all around the house. It was cute, but not at 4 am. This one easily stores in drawers when we need it to. I love that there\u2019s a variety of different attachments. He gets bored with the same thing after a while. Also worth mentioning that the string hanging off the pole is very light colored which helps them not realize that I\u2019m the one manipulating the toy, making it feel like more of a real hunt for him! The door hanging bungee- I\u2019ll be honest, when I first order this I was not expecting it to work or be anything special. I only got this pack because of the price and variety. But I was wrong. The part to hangs at the top of the doorframe is not loose like I thought it would be, it hasn\u2019t fallen or got pulled off yet (which is a miracle). Only thing I would comment on is that my lil guy ripped through that bungee cord in less than 4 hours. I don\u2019t think this was because of poor quality though. I think my cat just absolutely loved it and went to town on it. No joke, he was fully entertained all by himself with it. I can easily tie it back up so he can play with it again. It is really helpful for him to have something to keep his attention while I work from home. Overall, great product, great variety, so much fun.", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28CKD9YW86HR9", "review_author_id": "AEBTMW3OSTVSEM662ETRKIE2PLNA", "review_author": "kylie black", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEBTMW3OSTVSEM662ETRKIE2PLNA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "34 people found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B09Y85LJFR", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Style": "SET D"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "RSPFXAUPW60M3", "review_title": "This is awesome, great price, worth it", "review_comment": "My cat loves this.

Pros: - they love all the toy attachments - the wands telescope from the size pictured out to about 3 times in length. Great for adding versatility (if I'm sitting with them the short length is comfortable, but fully extended if I'm standing) and also for efficient storage. - our situation isn't appropriate for using the doorway attachment, but I gave it to a friend who has cats of her own and she says her cats love it. Cons: - nylon monofilament (fishing line) is used on the wands and kittens easily bit through it in their first play session. I replaced it with thin cord. - the \"worm\" looking toy attachments easily shred and are torn apart. The kittens love these, but I had to monitor them to make sure they didn't swallow any shreds. One worm lasted 2 days (4 play sessions) with my two, 6wk old siblings. Overall, I am very happy with this. The wand toys aren't meant to be left with the kittens unsupervised anyway, so when I saw the fishing line being bitten and the \"worm\" toys being torn apart, I just replaced/removed them.

However, after only having it a couple of weeks, the worms are shedding at their ends and falling apart, which can be dangerous because my cats can ingest the \u201cfur\u201d. The little purple rabbit fell apart too and chunks of the fur yarn was falling out so it no longer has a head no longer and I\u2019m afraid the cats could eat that too, so all of those went in the trash. All I have left are the two feathers which also follow apart easily. Also, the yellow string to attach to the wand unravels, so I had to burn the ends to stop it from falling apart. The clamp that goes around the door frame barely fits if you have moulding, and I\u2019ve already lost the rubber safety covers that help hold on the door frame.

However after I put the toy away in a drawer I found my cat pawing at the drawer wanting to get the toy out. It's now become a part of his daily play routine and a good tool for me to turn on for distracting him. That being said the toy does have some issues for our household that keep it from being a five star toy. I would advise owners to only use this toy while supervising their cat to assure the lure being used doesnt unravel or get swallowed by their cat. Watching play sessions is also important to assure you can monitor the location of the toy in case it gets stuck or you intended to keep it put away between play sessions. My cat primarily watches this toy and follows it around the house while it runs. 1. The attached lure/tail that is default attached falls apart easily. This lure is comprised of fine string giving a fur like spiral effect and while this style of lure was engaging and worked well with the toy for movement it quickly started to fall apart leaving little pieces of string in clumps around my house. This is a safety concern as my cat could have easily swallowed the string. Once this part of the toy starts to unravel it becomes very unsafe in my opinion. I do have an adult cat that enjoys aggressive play so at first I thought it was negligence on my part not closely monitoring play with the toy but watching play sessions after the initial discovery of strings being detached I continued to find small pieces of string that seemed to be organic decay rather than my cat removing them from the toy. There is a feather style lure that comes with the package that we switched to and have not had any new issues with it coming apart for safety. 2. This toy is very loud which can be a draw back or a benefit depending on your opinion. If the toy is on I know it's on, I can hear it's gears constantly working during a play session and while the noise isn't pleasant and might intimidate a cat it does make it easy to know the play session timed out or locate the toy if it's still running but stuck in an odd part of the house. 3. The toy struggles on my carpet. Our apartment has a mix of carpet and vinyl flooring. The toy is primarily used for play sessions on a carpeted area and needs an aggressive setting to assure it will be able to roll freely. However if it makes its way onto a section of the vinyl floor it will then turn into a shooting star zooming around at a high speed that can make it difficult to catch. 4. Play sessions are on the shorter side which could be a draw back. The toy doesn't run very long in my opinion when you turn it on but honestly I think that is for the best so that it doesn't accidentally travel too far and get stuck in an odd corner of the house. If it doesn't bump into obstacles it can still travel a fair distance for interactive play. I always start play sessions in the living room and have watched the toy maneuver its way to the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom of our home. 5. The toy can and for us regularly gets itself stuck. This thing almost acts like a it has a consciousness and will roll itself into an odd space that is literally just big enough for it to get into and get stuck. On more than one occasion I've had to get down on hands and knees to free it from under a desk or reposition it from a tight corner. This is might not be an issue if your cat is more interactive with the toy and will get it unstuck themselves (my cat really just watches the toy and follows it around the house).", "review_star_rating": "4", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IN8NNQCI9LCJ", "review_author_id": "AEBQNFOVIBBNR5K3TZ6ZNFJKVLLQ", "review_author": "Angel", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEBQNFOVIBBNR5K3TZ6ZNFJKVLLQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "4 people found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B0DLRH694Y", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Color": "Blue"}, "is_vine": false}], "top_reviews_global": [{"review_id": "R2O05WRCIEJCLN", "review_title": "Interactive Toy!!", "review_comment": "My cat who normally likes duo play, loves this toy!

They're like synchronized swimmers when playing with it, and its entertaining to watch. It also tires them out very quickly, so they go into the tunnel to nap. So I am not complaining. I mean, the male kitten seems to be afraid of the toy, but hes coming around... slowly. But all the others? It works like melatonin. Keeps them busy, cats and humans both have fun, you learn how many flips your cat can do in the air and how high they can jump. Well worth the purchase.

It was just shipped by itself in the original packaging, having a routing slip stuck to the original plastic package. So I thought that that was very practical and a way to reduce waste. When I open the product and straightened out the tunnel, what I noticed is that it is rather flimsy where the three tunnel pieces merge. It seems to me that those areas could potentially be reinforced. That is why I gave this a 4 star rating. Because the area where they join is not reinforced one of the tunnel pieces gets jacked up and kind of makes a tripod out of the tunnel. But that doesn\u2019t really affect my kittens interest in the toy. He still cruises through the tunnel and is very interested in the little ball that is attached to it. The package also came with what looked to be a flimsy little short handled wand toy, however, my kitten absolutely adores that toy. It\u2019s got a short handle and a stiff but springy wand. I can stick the handle under a seat cushion so the toy is elevated and he just has a ball, jumping and attacking the little feather toy that is attached to the end of the wand.

Cat toys: 1: is it worth it? 2: will they use it? 3: is it sturdy - will it last - hold up to nails/teeth? 1 - you decide for $13 2 - mine has kicking habits so they use the toy 3 - seems sturdy @4 months in Positives: I have 1 gray cat (12 yr old male) that plays with anything .. A N Y T H I N G and 1 black cat (7 yr old male) that only plays with red dot/flash lights, bugs and string - NO CAT TOYS - but he\u2019s seems to like this toy as long as the gray cat is also playing with one simultaneously. I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s because he sees him playing and is jealous (there\u2019s a lot of jealousy between these 2!) or if it\u2019s because the catnip attracts him and then he\u2019s hooked, or both. You can see both cats enjoy it. My gray cat is the one who likes to kick and has long rear nails (he plays very, very rough normally) and he enjoys the heck out of this toy. Even the big black cat will do an occasional kick with it. Negatives: The one thing is the little feather stuff. There\u2019s a few pieces that are longer (you can actually see it in one of the videos, the black cat playing with the green one it has a piece that's longer, and it goes across his face). My other gray cat eats anything. He\u2019s a total garbage disposal. He eats hair off the floor. He eats dust balls. He eats carpet pieces that have been picked up from their nails. Arg! I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s horrible. So, I am forever living with the behavior of cat/toddler proofing my home. If it could be picked up and put in the mouth or licked, it\u2019s bad. I know that\u2019s sad but it\u2019s the truth. So that\u2019s a negative because I picked up one of the pieces off the floor when they were new. And of course, the catnip doesn\u2019t stay for long. But I am getting the most life out of them as possible because I keep them in separate Ziploc baggies and don\u2019t let the air get to them when not in use. And last negative would be cost. I believe I paid $13 or so 11/27/23. When I replace these, since they don\u2019t last more than a few months before the catnip or the attraction portion of the play is gone from this toy, I\u2019ll be looking to replace them for at least, at minimum, 50% less than what I paid, or between $5-$7 tops. Notes: I keep/store these in a Ziploc plastic bag with the air removed (when not in use) and bring them out for a few minutes of play or until they\u2019re tired of it and then store it back in the baggie. So it seems to last longer I suppose. I bought this pack of 3 toys on 11/27/23 and they\u2019re just now getting to the point where I should be replacing them soon if I want them to enjoy the catnip portion as part of the toy. Overall. Good toy - sturdy, crinkly, decent cat-nippy smell, cats seem to enjoy them and their nails/teeth haven out any holes in them or scratched them apart. Also store them in a Ziploc baggie when not in use, the catnip part will last a bit longer. So if I\u2019m using a scale of 1-10 then maybe an 8-9 using my gray cat to measure because he loves to play normally and will play a long time due to the catnip. Also he has no teeth, so he slobbers on it, a lot, and I have to wait for it to dry before I can put it away in a baggie. Or it could just be because he plays with it so much more than the other cat that it\u2019s out of the Ziploc baggie more often, therefore, the catnip portion of it could be going away or not as strong. But he still plays with it and once I entice him, he really gets going with it.", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13ARZYTFZRCPG", "review_author_id": "AHWUP4W22WAQYTU3VUEOQJQ2YPYA", "review_author": "SoCalMissy", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHWUP4W22WAQYTU3VUEOQJQ2YPYA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/17e1d5f5-2c07-4018-a41e-f0992e54cb6e._CR0%2C0%2C500%2C500_SX460_.jpeg", "review_images": [], "review_video": {"stream_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-transcoding-artifact-us-east-1-prod/d5e0fcde-19c0-4eb4-b347-a1248bfaf12a/embedded.cc.default.vertical.jobtemplate.hls.m3u8", "closed_captions_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-closed-captions-artifact-us-east-1-prod/closedCaptions/c5d83c4f-216a-4add-a5b8-912166c7be12.vtt", "thumbnail_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Db+A50T2L._SY256.jpg"}, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "159 people found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B09WHBG4DV", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Color": "Green Yellow Violet"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R1VSUDCLJ40GDL", "review_title": "Good toy if you love your cat \ud83d\udc08!", "review_comment": "Our cat, Moash, couldn\u2019t wait for me to open the box when it came!

The toys don't look like much, just a furry oblong that crinkles when squished, but the shape is just right for a cat to grasp between front and back legs and roll around, kicking, biting and even licking. Of course the catnip inside the toy helps a lot! Having purchased quite a few toys over the years that claimed to contain catnip, I can tell you that a lot of times the catnip inside has gotten old and doesn't have much aroma, but these had obviously fresh, good quality catnip inside. The set of three comes in a sealed plastic bag and the only aroma I could smell when I opened the bag was catnip. And the cats could really smell it as they were all over me, trying to help get the bag open so they could get at the toys. I've bought several other cat toys from this brand, Potaroma, and have had good success with all of them. The 7 year old still plays with one of the other toys every day and we've had that toy for over two years.

For a start they look and feel lovely and come in nice packaging (useful for a gift). The kickers are made of soft materials and make a pleasant crinkling sound yet they are really hard-wearing, because after a major workout by my cat on the first one it looked as good as new, despite being quite damp from all the biting and pulling. They also seem to be full of catnip as he was completely and utterly obsessed by it for the first couple of hours. I bought these to entertain my indoor cat and also for exercising his hind legs, but he is quite big lengthwise and these particular kickers are probably designed more for small or medium cats. Nevertheless I know he will love the 2nd one when I present it to him down the track a bit. I will probably give away the 3rd one to a friend who has a smaller cat as it will make a delightful gift.", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TZSY19AE04ML", "review_author_id": null, "review_author": "Paulina", "review_author_url": null, "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in Australia on March 18, 2023", "is_verified_purchase": true, "reviewed_product_asin": "B09WHBG4DV", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Color": "Green Yellow Violet"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R3U22C7FV422KG", "review_title": "Super\ud83d\ude0a", "review_comment": "Mes petites chattes les adore", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U22C7FV422KG", "review_author_id": null, "review_author": "Laynya Couture", "review_author_url": null, "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in Canada on March 27, 2024", "is_verified_purchase": true, "reviewed_product_asin": "B09WHBG4DV", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Color": "Green Yellow Violet"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R1IQ0VJUSSA0NN", "review_title": "Sehr zufrieden", "review_comment": "Habe 4 Katzen,werden immer wieder genommen und mit gespielt.Echt Gut", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IQ0VJUSSA0NN", "review_author_id": null, "review_author": "Amazon Kunde", "review_author_url": null, "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in Germany on October 24, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "reviewed_product_asin": "B09WHBG4DV", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Color": "Green Yellow Violet"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R2C4M8US1JZVKF", "review_title": "The cats keep going back to them for playtime", "review_comment": "Smokey is 13+ years old and he only plays with this toy.

Like many Pet Parents, my pets are rescues. I found my kitty out fending for himself in a rural community. I thought he was a kitten at 2 pounds, but a trip to the vet told me he was a fully grown male, about a year old. So... he had his first year of life with all his outdoor instincts on alert for survival, and I am telling you - these \"SmartyKat Skitter Critters\" could not be safer from his wild-cat playfulness than if he was playing with a real one. When I first purchased these, I bought a small, 3-pack from the local big box store. I found myself returning a week later for two more packs because he'd either destroyed or hidden them. Through the years, I've regularly purchased the 3-pack sets in multiples, so I was happy to find this 10-toy value pack for less than I was paying for multiple 3-packs. Was there any difference in quality? No. **Before** I even had the bag open, my little cat was literally jumping up on me to get to them! I made him wait until I cut the tags off (see photo), and he was ready to go! If these were sold in 100-packs, I'd buy them! I will say that the \"stomach\" seam is easily ravaged. So buy them in multiples, and if you want them to last a little longer, get a needle and thread to quickly put a few stronger stitches in the \"stomach\" before you share them. Okay - case in point. Even as I am typing this review, my little cat (actually, he's not so little anymore) has gotten into the trash can beside my desk. Luckily, I had just emptied it, so I wondered what could be inside that was attracting him so much? Ha ha. It's the *tags* I cut off from the first SmartKat mouse toy I gave him! So yes, cats LOVE these! Besides ravaging them, he also chases them under things. So if you are missing a few, try sweeping a broom under your furniture, frig, dresser, china hutch, and under your sofas, ottomans, etc.. Use a broom. I wouldn't want one of these poly-filled mice to get stuck up in the vacuum wand. So we'll see how long this 10-pack lasts, but I do think I'll add a few stitches and see if that helps before giving them to him, and... put these on our \"Amazon Shopping List\" so we can easily find them for re-order (that and in our Returns and Orders tab). You can't go wrong with \"SmartyKat Skitter Critters\"! Don't waste time on the small pack. Go ahead and get the value pack. Otherwise, you'll be turning around and ordering them again soon! ...and with Christmas coming soon? They make great kitty cat stocking stuffers, too! The photos show: the 10-pack does come with ten mice. You can count them front or back. I've shown different close-up angles of this economical mouse. They do not look \"real\" like some of the more expensive ones, but cats love them just as much. I've always shown how I cut off the tags which I'd strongly recommend for the cat's safety.

I bought this laser pointer to play with my cat. This has been the most fun toy I have ever purchased and have laughed so hard to bring on tears!!!!! I have had laser pointers before, but the laser red dot was only visible for a short distance. This laser pointer has such extensive distance that is so much more enjoyable to watch my cat play all over the room and hallways with this pointer. One of the funniest things that I do with the pointer is after a series of flashing the red dot, I stop it and my cat goes crazy trying to find out where the red dot went to. I wait a few minutes and flash the red dot again and he goes crazy chasing after the red dot even more vigorously! I like the fact that the laser pointer has other symbols other than the red dot, has a butterfly, a happy face, and mouse which is a nice feature as well. However, the red Dot is his favorite to play with. The laser pointer is very well made, and I love the fact that you can plug it into a USB port and recharge it, never have to use batteries like all the other laser pointers on the market. The laser pointer takes no time at all charging it using the computer USB port for a faster charge. Your cat will than you for buying this laser pointer. BTW, this laser pointer really excites the cat, so careful the time of day you use it. For example, if you go to bed at night to sleep, do not play red dot with your cat, because he gets so excited, he will jump on your bed and wake you up to play more!

No expensive batteries needed. It also has a short rope attached to hang it and not lose it. I have bought several of these for my cat, extended family pets, the office, my vehicle and at home. I also like to take it . The flashlight is useful of course to get around in the dark and the laser pointer is kind of cool to point out Stars. So many uses and it's durable.

A separate plastic, horizontal rotating selector knob is near the top of the shaft to change the shapes of the laser, so easy to use with one hand. I have only had it about a week, but I haven't had to charge it yet so I don't know how long the battery will last. It came already charged and ready to go out of the package. It seems to be good quality and it also has a purple light that acts as a black light for checking kitties skin for ringworm and other fungal skin conditions and for detecting cat urine. Of course to use it that way you have to shine the purple light in the dark. It also has a white light that can be used as a mini flashlight which can be helpful for emergencies. It has a metal clip on it as well so you could clip it to a pocket if you want to carry it with you. There is a metal cap with a mini lanyard strap attached that can be pulled off for access to the usb-a connector which is used to charge this device. You can plug it in to the usb power port on a computer or other powered usb ports available. I like this rechargeable laser pointer much better than past ones I've bought that use button cell batteries. It seems to be a good quality product so far and the price was reasonable.", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLRIXWQ1VPI5Z", "review_author_id": "AH3D3SQJYRN4WWPLPOWGLMHSX2BQ", "review_author": "1brightstar", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH3D3SQJYRN4WWPLPOWGLMHSX2BQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "6 people found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B0D6W8B4FM", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Size": "1pc red light"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R1FTA7ZAV8B3GB", "review_title": "Gets the job done", "review_comment": "Good, works, has a few different shapes it does like a mouse, smiley face, star, and regular pointer.

This is the secret weapon against kitties who ignore other toys.", "review_comment": "I've worked in 3 cat shelters and 2 cat kennels, and these are the one thing that you'd five in all five locations. These are magic. I've handled hundreds of cats and kittens, and this is the number one toy I reach for. There's a few big reasons why this toy is great. 1) You can use both sides of it. Feel shy kitties that are easily overstimulated you can use the back side with the single cardboard roll. 2) the movement from the spring steel perfectly bounces around in a way that cats find interesting and also minimize the amount of work you have to do. You can largely hold it still and the cat will bounce it around on their own, making extended playtime sessions as easy as just holding the Dancer. I'll even close one end in a drawer and let the other size hang out and the kitty will play with it without you even having to be there. 3) This is a big one: cats secretly just love trash. Hairties, boxes, ball of tape, balls of paper, paper bags, ziptie, etc. Cats will always choose random trash over a fancy toy, and this toy simulates that by being made with trash, which I say with absolute love in my heart because cats ALWAYS choose this toy over others, and this is priced to match the materials. It's always seemed like the only toy where the creator paid attention to what cats actually like and not what they think humans will think is cute. So again, its: Cheap Loved by cats above any other toy Simulates chasing a bug Very active play Requires minimal work from the human Sold literally anywhere cat stuff is Recommended by every feline professional Do your kitty a favor and buy like 6 of these. This is easily the best cat toy ever made and they cost like no money. As a cat professional, I guarantee your cat will love this to death.", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15RRYELJ2SV1M", "review_author_id": "AED4WOW7NJUTEE7GFAKYNRMDGFDQ", "review_author": "Jason Lihani", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AED4WOW7NJUTEE7GFAKYNRMDGFDQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "11 people found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B0006N9I68", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Unit Count": "1"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R4XCVSAFSKM7R", "review_title": "Playtime has been revamped! (My toes approve lol)", "review_comment": "Our cat, Gremlin, has recently been kind of ignoring her other three wand type toys but she\u2019s only about a year old and has a lot of energy so she\u2019s been a bit of a menace. And has been attacking our toes. A lot. I got her this toy because about ten years ago I recall having purchased this for my sister\u2019s cats and them loving it. The verdict has been reached: People, this is the best $4 I have ever spent on my cat! She is going absolute nutty over this thing!! Backflips, somersaults, and aerial ambush attacks all included lol. I think this toy\u2019s wiggling, bouncing motion is really what makes all the difference. Gremlin has been super excited the handful of times an unfortunate fly has gotten into our house. She stalks and smacks this toy just like she does with flies. It also kind of bounces and wiggles like a flying insect when I hold it so I think that, plus the unpredictable way that it moves, keeps Gremlin very entertained! I will let it wiggle through the air but also drag it along the floor and across the couch etc to keep playtime varied and interesting. We\u2019ve had this toy for three days now and as a result all other toys are being ignored lol. Our cat seems to especially like chewing on the cardboard end of the toy. The small size of the cardboard lure seems to keep it from being overwhelming or intimidating for our kitty, who is known for ignoring large plushie style cat toys. The design of this toy is extremely simple but in its simplicity lies the brilliance. It catches our cat\u2019s attention without being overly complicated or bulky and the quality of the wire and cardboard seem good. The wire is pretty study so it maintains its shape but still springs back and forth easily. I can also appreciate that, just like the original I bought a decade ago, it\u2019s made in a US factory and a solar-powered one at that! At least, according to the tag :) I also appreciate that the packaging is minimal and with that it\u2019s reducing the amount of needless plastic waste. So, in summary this toy is cat-approved, easy to use, really inexpensive, well-made and eco friendly. This is definitely worth trying out for your cats!", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4XCVSAFSKM7R", "review_author_id": "AGORYHMEBWMO7XWS4FJYFZ5CQKKA", "review_author": "Charlie", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGORYHMEBWMO7XWS4FJYFZ5CQKKA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "3 people found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B0006N9I68", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Unit Count": "1"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R33ZDZ6U7MPYYN", "review_title": "Cats are obsessed with what is basically bits of trash", "review_comment": "This toy is priced right for what it is -- coat hanger wire with a few bits of kraft paper attached. However, the effects of this trash mash-up are pure magic. The way the wire is bent and the way the papers are attached, it creates a bobbing, insect-like movement in the air and my cats are obsessed. There is something about the movement of the paper bits that unlock some sort of primal instinct to hunt fluttery things. My cats (7 months and 3 years old) will play with this thing longer than most other toys. It makes no sound, uses no batteries, requires almost no human effort to operate and provides massive play time bang for the buck. So far, the little paper bits have held up to much abuse, but it does appear that replacements can be had from the manufacturer. My cats love it so much that I told my parents to get one for their young cat and guess what... he also loves it. We even ended up buying a second one so two humans can entertain both cats at the same time (or one human using both hands).", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33ZDZ6U7MPYYN", "review_author_id": "AELJS6ZZZAFKYZX4APVVNPPZUT2Q", "review_author": "Gen X Introvert ", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELJS6ZZZAFKYZX4APVVNPPZUT2Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/25d26de0-f7c8-44cd-b0ff-c322b4ccaca0._CR0%2C0%2C500%2C500_SX460_.jpeg", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2025", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "One person found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B0006N9I68", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Unit Count": "2"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R31MR7AZ80VD13", "review_title": "Cat loves", "review_comment": "My cats love this toy and go nuts for it.

I adopted Gwendalyn, who is just over a year old, about a month ago. So, she's still getting adjusted to some extent and has a LOT of energy. I have lots of toys for her but she doesn't really seem to know how to play by herself. Which during the day is fine, but at 3am it's rough! So, I looked into interactive toys. Gwen loves her string toys and hunting for toys, so this toy seemed perfect! And it really is. She loves it!! So much so that if she hears the beep from me turning it off, she comes running and whining. So, while I'd originally only intended to have it available to her overnight, it's now a 24/7 toy. You need 4 AA batteries, which I'm fine with, but know it's not a chargeable toy. There is a cord that you can use to plug into the wall, but then the toy has to be by a wall/outlet. Modes are nice, 4 different options. It is good about going into standby after 5mins and shutting off 2hrs later (if toy activated from standby, everything resets time wise). It doesn't really stay put on hardwood floors, which I why I set it on basic grippy shelf liner, which works fine. Only complaints I have are that when toy is reactivated, it beeps a bit loudly (especially if at night and in your room). Not sure why felt need to have it beep for that, as you can hear the toy going, though toy not as loud as the beep). Also, for some reason, when it switches modes, goes into standby, or even turns off, the whack-a-mole piece sometimes stays sticking out. I learned that when I heard, then saw, my cat carrying/dragging the toy across the room with holding that piece in her mouth. It would be nice if it always finished inside the toy. Doubly nice would be if it locked (or something) in place inside, as I now can't use the feather or the floofy feathery strand thingie bc she can very easy dig them out, and will chew and carry the toy using them way more than with just the worm piece. My last issue relates to those whack-a-mole pieces. So, we can only really use the \"worm\" piece, which is fine as she loves it and she's better with it. But, if I need to replace it, I have to buy a pack that's 2 worms, 2 feathers, and 2 floofy things for around $10...when I will only be able to use 2 of the 6 items. I wish could get individual types so I'm not wasting money. Gripes aside, this toy really is great and at a good price too. Gwen truly loves it and finds it fun and soothing, so that makes me love it. I definitely recommend.", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I2DB1RDPO8W7", "review_author_id": "AEELAU3UKIFLKZJGH2YT5JOOP7VQ", "review_author": "G J Finlay", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEELAU3UKIFLKZJGH2YT5JOOP7VQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png", "review_images": [], "review_video": {"stream_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-transcoding-artifact-us-east-1-prod/ed620b4f-56de-4ae0-ac37-2aa85985977f/default.vertical.jobtemplate.hls.m3u8", "closed_captions_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-closed-captions-artifact-us-east-1-prod/closedCaptions/de8c29b6-ea0b-42f9-b078-e0e09b76830d.vtt", "thumbnail_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Q2QHRNCkL._SY256.jpg"}, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2024", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "158 people found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B0B5TD8CTF", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Color": "White"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R32CHSZQGTQIJU", "review_title": "Puurrrrrfect Cat Toy and Replacement Toys", "review_comment": "UPDATE: Jun 5, 2023 For durability, I have to give this toy a 1,000-STAR Rating, my cats have dragged this toy all over the house playing with it, they have turned it upside down, pounced on it with full force and this toy has suffered NO DAMAGE whatsoever! First cat toy that seems very impervious to cat's very aggressive behaviors! I have found this toy in one of our 2 bathrooms, in our bedroom under the bed, all over the living room and kitchen/dinging room area. And it hasn't stopped working, even with being dragged, bumped, knocked, turned upside down (while still operating). I am very impressed with how this 3-in-1 cat toy has held up to my cat's abuse of it, and still working. This is one toy I can feel very confident in and has definitely been manufactured very well with a cat's aggressive behavior in mind, definitely would recommend this Potaroma cat toy. Just make sure you buy replacement parts, as cats will murder the feathers and butterflies in about 2 to 3 days, sometimes they may kill one in a day, but most have lasted about 3 days before a replacement is needed, sometimes longer. I just repurchased the second set of replacements for mine and got them in one day, as I had already gone through my first set of replacement toys I purchased at the same time I purchased the main toy, I purchased both replacements, the butterflies and the feathers, each type sold separately. My only small complaint is the one feather that comes with the butterflies, it doesn't have the same type of wire, there is no coiled spring near the bottom of the wire, so it gets bent out of shape much easier than the butterflies do, which makes it a little more difficult to straighten out when the cats bend it to the ground. The coiled wires are a bit better, but I think if the coiled section were a slight bit longer and maybe a little closer to where the wire comes out of the base, then it wouldn't bend over as easily, but like stated, to me, that's a very minor issue. As for battery duration, as stated in my original review I use Amazon Rechargeable batteries for all my devices, and these have held up extremely well in this particular \"motorized\" cat toy, I keep a spare set recharged for when I need to change the batteries out, and most often they get changed out after 24 hours of use, as my cats play with this toy constantly, it doesn't get much resting time with the number of cats I have activating it, and playing with it. Regular alkaline batteries would have been dead in just a few hours of playtime, so, again, I definitely would recommend the Amazon AA Rechargeable Batteries for this toy, I use the 850mAh in my devices, and they have never let me down yet. I have been using them for a couple of years now, and they have outlasted any other battery, as well as any name brand rechargeable batteries I have used and that have never lasted as long, or as reliable in my devices, unlike the Amazon Rechargeable batteries, they have outperformed and outlasted them all, and I've used a lot of name brand rechargeables over the years, none have even come close to the satisfaction I get from Amazons Rechargeable Batteries! My cats are very happy with this toy and is one of only TWO toys they use every single day and multiple times a day. The only other toy they use daily is a 5 way cat tunnel I bought for them, and yes, I have even found the 3-in-1 toy dragged inside the tunnel toy too. They also love to hide in the tunnel and jump out at the 3-in-1 toy while it's in action. So, if you want an excellent cat toy that is truly durable, this Potaroma 3-in-1 cat toy will do very nicely. I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND this toy as one of the best cat toys out there. BTW: the toy is also very quiet when in operation, it does make some clicking sounds as the feather peeks in and out of the chamber at the bottom, but it's not loud enough to really disturb anyone, that this may depend on the individual. I just know for my wife and I, the clicking isn't all that noticeable, plus when we do hear it, we know the cats are playing with their toy again. :) ========================== END JUNE 5, 2023 UPDATE - Original Review Below =============== DISLIKES: None, just don't know why it is asking for a rating on Suction and Motion Detection, as this toy doesn't have those options, and why I rated those as 1-Star. Likes: At first all, but one of my 3-month-old kittens were hesitant to approach the toy, I have 3 males and 1 female, one male is *ALWAYS* the first to check out any new cat toy, if he plays with it, the others usually follow suit in a very short time, his name is Winterfrost, and he GETS INTO EVERYTHING! LOL My wife did take some video of them playing with the toy on her cell phone, if I can figure out how to get it to my computer, I'll upload it as soon as I can. The other 3 sat and watched, then the other 2 males, named Goldstar and Ezekiel joined in shortly after they saw how much fun Winterfrost was having chasing the butterfly, batting at the balls, and catching the feather, but the lone female (Serena) would still skirt around them and jump out of their way, still unsure about the toy. Eventually, she saw how much fun her brothers were having with it and finally joined in the play, then momma (Lily Blossom) got into the act with her kittens. It arrived somewhere near 2pm, I believe, and they have been playing with it NON-STOP since they got it! It's now almost 5pm, and they are still working on it, although I had to go on a hunt and destroy mission to find the butterfly that Serena (never expected her to be the first one) had managed to get completely off the toy! Winterfrost is who I figured would be the first to get the butterfly off the toy. ROFL I buy and use Amazon Rechargeable AA batteries, and after 3 hours of non-stop action, they are still going strong in the toy, most standard or even alkaline batteries DO NOT hold up nearly this long in a \"motorized\" for this type of duration. So, I would definitely recommend you buy Amazon AA Rechargeable Batteries for this cat toy, they hold up far longer than any standard battery, I've been using the Amazon AA and AAA rechargeables in many of my cat toys that require batteries, and I have not been disappointed with their performance in such hard, long use, especially in the motorized cat toys! Well worth investing in them, just make sure you get a good charger, one that can handle multiple batteries, I have a 10 Battery Charger for them. And it can also charge 2 9V batteries at the same time, which I have some remote controlled cat toys that use a 9V battery, and I use the in everything battery operated. I can highly recommend this cat toy, even my outdoor cats that come inside under inclement weather or just when they want to come in love this toy, and these cats age in range from 8\u201311 years old, and even they enjoyed it when the kittens would give them a chance at it! ROFL Oh, and by the way, folks have mistakenly said this toy will not let you have the butterfly and feather both work at the same time, perhaps older models may not, but the one I received has a little white pushbutton next to the switch, that button is for locking the feather in the out position, so it can be changed when damaged or missing from the cats aggressive play, but that button also serves another purpose (the owner's manual covers this), press once after selecting the slide switch position, this button is next to the slide switch, turn on the main switch from off to either feather or butterfly, then press and release the white button, this will turn on both the peek-a-boo feather and have the butterfly flittering around at the same time, but the slide switch must be in either of these two \"ON\" positions for the button to function, setting both toys in action. As I was writing this review, my cats are finally worn out from all the play and are just resting, but they refuse to go far away from their new toy, and they figured out how to activate it and keep it going for the entertainment, as it never shut off after the 4-minute timer would have run out. I've purchased other types of cat animated toys, laser toys that do things, but this one has to be my kittens and cat's all-time favorite toy, they have NEVER spent 3 hours playing with a single toy before, usually 15\u201320 minutes, and they're done, this one got a nice 3-hour workout with them right after I got it! Seems to be very durable, even though my cats were dragging it around when they would catch the butterfly and hold it down, playing keep away from the other kittens and cats that wanted it. I had just as much enjoyment watching them take to, then play with this toy for such a long period of time, so unlike most cats, but then I've heard people comment I have some strange and unique cats. ROFLMBO Again, I definitely can recommend this cat toy, and I highly recommend Amazon Rechargeable Batteries for it. Believe it or not, but I have had much longer run times and play time with cat toys with Amazon brand Rechargeable batteries over any other brand of rechargeable, Amazon's Rechargeable batteries surpassed every other \"name brand\" rechargeable battery I have ever bought, and why I will continue to buy Amazon Rechargeable batteries for all my battery powered cat toys and other battery powered devices. Sure beats having to go out and buy replacement batteries every time they go dead, and I always keep a spare set charged so their playtime is not disrupted for very long! I hope your purr babies enjoy this toy as much as my cats are. This has to be the very best toy I ever bought them. I'd give this toy 100-Stars if I could!", "review_star_rating": "5", "review_link": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32CHSZQGTQIJU", "review_author_id": "AFQBQNJ3DYBZNL6VIGTB3FMFY7VA", "review_author": "Cataptra", "review_author_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQBQNJ3DYBZNL6VIGTB3FMFY7VA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8", "review_author_avatar": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/5b4c8191-6129-476e-a60d-1498f960b58a._CR62%2C0%2C375%2C375_SX460_.jpg", "review_images": [], "review_video": null, "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2023", "is_verified_purchase": true, "helpful_vote_statement": "203 people found this helpful", "reviewed_product_asin": "B0B5TD8CTF", "reviewed_product_variant": {"Color": "White"}, "is_vine": false}, {"review_id": "R89IRSZHO65XI", "review_title": "My cat loves this toy", "review_comment": "I purchased this toy for our cat after a family member received one as a gift for her new kitten.

I also like that it can be completely turned off or activated by motion. I have also purchased additional butterflies and feathers, as my cat eventually catches them and wears them out. I recently contacted the company about an issue with the toy and received amazing service with a personal touch.
