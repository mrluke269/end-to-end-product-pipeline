        "review_title": "SmartyKat Skitter Critters Value Pack Catnip Cat Toys - for your **Smart Cat**!!",
        "review_comment": "The media could not be loaded. Like many Pet Parents, my pets are rescues. I found my kitty out fending for himself in a rural community. I thought he was a kitten at 2 pounds, but a trip to the vet told me he was a fully grown male, about a year old. So... he had his first year of life with all his outdoor instincts on alert for survival, and I am telling you - these \"SmartyKat Skitter Critters\" could not be safer from his wild-cat playfulness than if he was playing with a real one. When I first purchased these, I bought a small, 3-pack from the local big box store. I found myself returning a week later for two more packs because he'd either destroyed or hidden them. Through the years, I've regularly purchased the 3-pack sets in multiples, so I was happy to find this 10-toy value pack for less than I was paying for multiple 3-packs. Was there any difference in quality? No. **Before** I even had the bag open, my little cat was literally jumping up on me to get to them! I made him wait until I cut the tags off (see photo), and he was ready to go! If these were sold in 100-packs, I'd buy them! I will say that the \"stomach\" seam is easily ravaged. So buy them in multiples, and if you want them to last a little longer, get a needle and thread to quickly put a few stronger stitches in the \"stomach\" before you share them. Okay - case in point. Even as I am typing this review, my little cat (actually, he's not so little anymore) has gotten into the trash can beside my desk. Luckily, I had just emptied it, so I wondered what could be inside that was attracting him so much? Ha ha. It's the *tags* I cut off from the first SmartKat mouse toy I gave him! So yes, cats LOVE these! Besides ravaging them, he also chases them under things. So if you are missing a few, try sweeping a broom under your furniture, frig, dresser, china hutch, and under your sofas, ottomans, etc.. Use a broom. I wouldn't want one of these poly-filled mice to get stuck up in the vacuum wand. So we'll see how long this 10-pack lasts, but I do think I'll add a few stitches and see if that helps before giving them to him, and... put these on our \"Amazon Shopping List\" so we can easily find them for re-order (that and in our Returns and Orders tab). You can't go wrong with \"SmartyKat Skitter Critters\"! Don't waste time on the small pack. Go ahead and get the value pack. Otherwise, you'll be turning around and ordering them again soon! ...and with Christmas coming soon? They make great kitty cat stocking stuffers, too! The photos show: the 10-pack does come with ten mice. You can count them front or back. I've shown different close-up angles of this economical mouse. They do not look \"real\" like some of the more expensive ones, but cats love them just as much. I've always shown how I cut off the tags which I'd strongly recommend for the cat's safety. And... a 12-second video \"ad\" right out of the bag!",

She's 4 years old now and the nesting is stronger than it was before she was younger. I bought many of these through the years, highly recommend . inside is a little catnip to give a scent for hunting and when they get between something. Making it easier for the cat to find toy mouse.

What\u2019s even funnier is that the dog tried to steal one, too. Apparently, these toys are irresistible across species! Luckily, the pack comes with three, so there\u2019s always a backup when one disappears under the couch. They\u2019re the perfect size, durable enough to withstand constant play, and the catnip clearly does its magic. If you want a toy your cat will love (and protect like it\u2019s gold), this is it.",

The multi pack was great and a great price - I bought two. We may graduate to bigger toys once she's less entertained or when I get tired of constantly fishing them from under the sofa, whichever occurs first.",
