        "review_comment": "As a dog owner who\u2019s dealt with two scary emergencies\u2014both of my pups needed surgery for intestinal obstructions from swallowing pieces of flimsy toys\u2014I\u2019ve been on a mission to find truly tough toys that can withstand heavy chewing and be left unsupervised in the yard. These tough dog toys fit the bill perfectly after testing them for about two weeks with my five energetic dogs (a mix of Labs and Shepherds, all avid chewers). Coming in a pack of three, I grabbed two packs to ensure everyone had their own, and so far, they\u2019re holding up amazingly without any signs of being ingested or destroyed. Pros: \u2022 Ultimate durability and safety: Made from a super-resilient rubber material that\u2019s flexible yet unbreakable, these have survived intense gnawing sessions. My dogs drag them around, chew for hours, and even play tug-of-war\u2014no chunks broken off, no splintering, and zero risk of pieces being swallowed. This is a game-changer for owners like me who\u2019ve paid vet bills in the thousands from past toy failures. \u2022 Engaging for multiple dogs: All five of mine show real interest, batting them around the yard or carrying them like treasures. The textured surface seems to keep them entertained without boredom setting in quickly. \u2022 Great value in packs: At three per pack, it\u2019s easy to distribute among a multi-dog household, and they\u2019re weather-resistant too\u2014left outside in rain and sun, they haven\u2019t degraded or gotten slimy. Cons: \u2022 Limited customization options: While the quality is top-notch, I\u2019d love more variety in pack quantities (like a single or a 10-pack for bigger families), designs (maybe bone-shaped or with treat-hiding features), and colors (currently basic\u2014brighter ones could help spot them in grass easier). In real-world use, I scattered them in the backyard and checked daily: bite marks are superficial, and clean-up is simple with a hose rinse (no lingering odors). Compared to Kong extremes or Nylabones I\u2019ve tried, these are softer on teeth but tougher against destruction\u2014my 80-lb Lab hasn\u2019t made a dent. Sized at about 6 inches each, they\u2019re ideal for medium to large breeds but might be oversized for tiny pups. If you have destructive chewers or worry about obstruction risks like I do, these are a must-buy for safe, unsupervised play. Highly recommend starting with one pack to test\u2014I\u2019ve already ordered more as backups. Worth every penny for the stress relief alone!",

Based upon her need to meet everything with her mouth and other behaviors our vet suspected she is still co.ing out of her puppy stage. I bought her these toys to give her something to chew and she absolutely loved them. I distributed one out to her after a few days to peak her interest as the shape was different for each and this kept her attention. She isn't an aggressive chewer but she does have a successful bite so these have lasted longer than some of her other chew toys. Highly recommend for older puppies/young adult pitties who need variety in their chew toys options.",

He destroys EVERYTHING, Bark Box Super chewers don't stand a chance with him, Usually nothing lasts longer than 2 days, if we make it 1 day we call it a keeper. These are WONDERFUL I got the three pack and gave him one at a time and almost 2 months later all three are still going strong- they don't chip, and I am not finding little pieces all over my house, so I don't have to worry about him swallowing small pieces. They are the perfect size for my medium sized dog. He loves the variety in shape and frequently alternates which one he chews on, and even takes it to bed with him, and you cant beat the price! with a dog who likes to play rough they are light enough that don't crush your toes when he inevitably drops the toy on your foot, and the colors are cute so its a win win for all around!

Kinda hard to capture, but the pieces that are chewed into are hard and sharp feeling and I don't think I'm going to keep this toy. We got a few days use out of it, but tonight I realized it was actually getting chewed into. I have an American Bully and was hoping to find the perfect toy. I'm surprised to read the reviews from people with bullies giving it 5 stars.. I'm giving it 4 only because it is a strong material and my dog did enjoy chewing it",
