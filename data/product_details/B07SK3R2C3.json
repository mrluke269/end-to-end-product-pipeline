My other dog who is older age 6 lives it as well as the rubber is gentler on her teeth. They even play tug of war and aggressively chew and it holds up! It\u2019s also a very good fetch stick for playing fetch. It\u2019s flexible and smells of clean rubber. It\u2019s about 9 or 10 inch\u2019s long and smaller than a silver dollar in diameter pretty light for its size. Has a nice bounce to it as well when throwing or even just tossing.Also Amazon has had the best price for this toy so far, coming in at about 5 dollars cheaper than some retail pet stores. 10 out of 10 I definitely recommend!",

This is our solution! It is on repeat in my Amazon cart (more so because she loses them). Super lightweight (so easy to throw) but heavy enough for a weak arm like me to get some good distance. It bounces! Our pittie loves this as it surprises her by veering in a different direction. It is bright orange so way easier to find in long grass after the pittie gets distracted by an animal. And it is sturdy. She can chew on it for weeks. However, once she gets a little piece gnawed off, that's my sign to order a replacement (I usually have another week or so before the original one is demolished). And you can't beat the price! Great investment as it lasts for months.",

IT DOES NOT FLOAT. IT WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM OF ANY WATER WAY. Unfortunately the disription DOES NOT clearly say that, which it should. Durability is great, my dogs love to play fetch so it works well for that. I would give more stars if they just would of made clear it does not float. Misleading customers is not a good way to do business especially in today's market. I'd would not recommend this product find a company that cares enough about customers that they are honest and upfront with us.",
