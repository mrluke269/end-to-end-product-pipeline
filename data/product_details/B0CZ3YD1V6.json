My cats and their kitty cousins both have a fascination with being bad kitties. They express this behavior by trying to chew on plastic and eat string. I figured I figured at least one kitty from each house hold would enjoy it but i was pleasantly surprised to see how all 4 kitties enjoyed this toy. They can chew on it, kick it, yeet it around, and it has catnip. I would buy this again (and i did)",

Two of the ropes are holding up nicely while one has started to unravel; which was quickly (temporarily) solved by knotting the two fraying ends. Advertising feels a little off, but each cat is different and has their own quirks.",

The older two don't play much in general, but these are very enticing to them. The cord is thick and sturdy enough that we aren't worried about anyone rolling too much and getting trapped or hurt, and the design is perfect for different types of play depending on your cat. It can be a little tug of war, a kicking string, chewy toy, and the movement is very eye catching to them when wiggled! Definitely will purchase again if they somehow find a way to lose or destroy them. Very cute to watch the cats bat at it and toss it around.",

I did cut it off because my boy is a very big cat and has very large sharp teeth. I was afraid he would chew it off and swallow it. He played with it for a little while, but I feel this toy is more for little kittens. My cat did not enjoy it that much unless I played with it with him. Now I can't find it. Maybe he put it in his toybox. From pictures posted it looks like cats were liking it very much. Probably last a while, not a noisy toy, it's like a very stiff worm/snake toy. Might want to rethink that ball of whatever it is, make it bigger or don't put it on at all. Seems a few people just cut it off.",

But I do think he gets lonely and bored, so I need to play with him every day for at least 45 min to 2 hours sometimes more. He enjoys the ropes because they\u2019re bitable, which helps him clean his teeth and they are good for sinking claws into without getting hurt. as they get older \u2013 which will happen in about a week \u2013 you will need to replace them to keep his interest, but they\u2019re not that expensive so it\u2019s OK. I like that they\u2019re nontoxic. I worry about toys with plastic bits because my cat likes to chew on everything.",

I was a little worried about the strings on the end but they're thick enough to where her cat leaves them alone. They don't tear off easily or anything. I think the rope is a good thickness as well. He can chew on it without harming his teeth and it's durable enough to where it doesn't break apart easily or anything. I did cut off the little Gal fruit on it. I know it's technically not harmful to cats, but it was really tough and I was scared of him swallowing it.",
