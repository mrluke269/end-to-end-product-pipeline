    "product_description": "At Benebone, we started with the premise that dogs experience scent and flavor in a way we can't even grasp. So, we ditched the neon colors and loud squeaks. Inspired by the dog's powerful sense of smell, we developed a long-lasting durable chew that's jam-packed with real flavor. Once your dog takes a bite of our USA-made chews, he'll be hooked.Instructions for Use and Safety Information: While recognizing that weight limit is a rough guide, our small products are for dogs under 30 lbs, our medium products are for dogs under 60 lbs, and our large products are for dogs under 90 lbs. Always choose the largest size your dog can handle. Benebone nylon chew toys carry risk. They are for dogs only and are not to be eaten. Chewing should always be supervised. Discard after reasonable wear. Benebones may cause an allergic reaction in humans or animals that are allergic to one or more components, such as nylon, peanuts, chicken, peppermint or pork.

        "review_comment": "This little multi-pack is cost-effective in a few ways, super durable and effective, and I'll definitely be purchasing the multi-pack again. We discovered these about a year ago and have been buying them ever since. I'm just now getting around to reviewing them because they're that good, plus I love that the company is family-owned. Four \"bones\" lasts a little over a month for a power chewer, which is a bargain! You get 4 medium size \"bones\" for the retail price of 2. These smell delicious to dogs but humans can detect the odor, which is so nice. They are incredibly durable, but somehow also not too hard for a power chewer, and they keep pup from chewing on books and other items that we don't wanted chewed to bits. Heavy chewers (and their people!) love these and the variety of shapes means we can swap them out in rotation and keep pup's interest going for a few weeks. Wait until your pup has all of their adult teeth, as they are a little too hard for teething. And for super power chewers, watch out for the fish shaped chew, as this one seems to allow larger pieces to be chewed off the fish head \"corners\" more easily due to the relative thinness of the shape at that point when compared to the other 3 shapes. Keep an eye on how much your power chewer is taking off of these \"bones\" (little tiny pieces do get chewed off) and toss them (or recycle with Benebone!) when your dog is able to chew off more than a crumb size piece. Hooray for Benebone! Hooray for family-owned businesses! We'll be back for more!",
