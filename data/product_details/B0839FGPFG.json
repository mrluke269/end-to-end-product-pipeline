He throws and bats it around, then picks it up and runs, carrying it in his mouth, and then drops it and chases it again. He actually plays until he wears himself out. I also LOVE the fact that if you happen to step on one with bare feet (I accidentally did) they don't break and/or hurt or stab you; instead, they just kinda collapse and flatten sideways, and then spring back into shape when you lift your foot. Such a great toy and you can't beat the price!! I absolutely recommend these for your kitty-kids!",

We bought various toys for her to try and get her to feel a bit more herself again. These springs were the jackpot. One could say they really sprung her to life again. She absolutely loves them. They have quite a bounce which make them fun for her to attack and knock around. They have been durable and hold up her batting. Since they are soft enough we don't have to worry about the end of the springs hurting her paws. They were an absolutely great buy for an energetic cat who needs an outlet.",
