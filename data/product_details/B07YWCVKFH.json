The durability receives mixed feedback - while some say they last a long time, others report they shred in less than 10 minutes. The squeaking feature also gets mixed reviews, with some loving the crinkle noise while others report quick destruction of the squeakers. While some customers say they're good for aggressive chewers, others note they're not suitable for strong chewers.",

Right out of the box, our BFFs were so excited and immediately grabbed one to run around with. Each toy in the assortment is a nice size \u2013 perfect for any size dogs who love to chew, toss, and squeak their toys to their heart\u2019s content. The variety is great, keeping playtime fresh and fun. Multiple squeakers, which really keeps our dogs engaged. The material is soft but surprisingly durable \u2013 we\u2019ve had them for a couple of weeks now, and not a single tear, which is impressive considering my dog usually destroys toys within days. This bundle offers excellent value for the price \u2013 five quality toys in one pack! It's also a great option if you\u2019re looking to stock up on gifts for your dog or even for a dog-loving friend. I\u2019ll definitely be buying another set when we need replacements. Highly recommend!",

They aren't made for being a tug toy, but they hold up pretty well. We know that they are going to be ripped apart, but at least there is no stuffing to pick up. The squeakers are sewn into a fabric pouch, so they are easy to pick up--no plastic parts chewed up.",
