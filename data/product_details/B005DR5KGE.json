He still likes to chew on and play with toys sometimes. I wasn\u2019t sure if he would like this Lamb Chop plush toy because it\u2019s almost as big as he is. Haha, But he loves it. He lies his head on the toy, chews on it, or sometimes keeps it by his side. He\u2019s had it for a couple of months now and he immediately chewed off one ear, but he\u2019s left the other ear alone. I assume he likes it better this way. Haha Very glad I purchased this toy. Very study. It took a while for my dog to chew off the ear, I was surprised he did it. The rest of the toy is in great shape even with all the chewing. I will toss the toy somewhere and tell him to, \u201cGo get Lamb Chop.\u201d He enjoys this for a little while. The toy is well-made, so cute, soft, and a good value for your money.",

        "review_comment": "Adorable & nice but... I hate writing adverse reviews but I had to for this one. It lasted exactly 1 minute. 30 seconds of that was Ghost pulling the rest of the stuffing out to completely gut this Lambie. I know what happened-The material on the chest and the little red buttons were the issue. Cute as it may be, that material is terrible. My Great Pyrenees/AmStaff/Golden Retriever Mix boy, Kota-Ghost, very rarely tears his stuffy squeaky toys up. He is only 7 months old and has only shown interest in tearing something up if it was already broken(had an existing rip or tear)This is only the 2nd or 3 toy he has torn up in his whole life(and he literally has at least 30 stuffy toys(some left by my sweet Bella--she passed away in March but most are brand new because when I saw he wasn't a Destructo-Dog, I went a bit overboard buyin him stuffies-So much that my Hubs was not happy with me but he was secretly glad I did it\ud83d\ude08.) See my review for the Jumbo Lambchop toy-That toy was and IS quite possibly the best stuffed squeaky toy available for bigger dogs. Only the MultiPet brand Jumbo tho-There are other brands that arent great. You can tell by the materials used on the face of the real Jumbo 24 inch ones from MultiPet. The Jumbo was a much better experience for us! I have also ordered the smaller one for him becuz he really wants the cat's lambie toy too. They have the 6 inch, not the \"cat toy\" version and they(and Ghost)love it. No one tears it up. I'll review it once his is delivered because while I know he doesnt rip the 6 inch one apart it is technically the cat's toy(not his) and we usually make him give it back to them pretty quickly. Ill review it when he gets his own & is allowed to do whatever he chooses. Hopefully he will treat it like Jumbo Lambie...Ok well, maybe not exactly that way cuz...Well, Lets just say he gets very, erhmm, frisky with his Jumbo Lambie. He doesnt like when we wash her but we do. Unfortunately he tries to take her outside in the dirt, in the pool with him. I will mention that more in my review for Jumbo Lambie. As for this standing up version-It MIGHT be fine for your dog or cat but it definitely was not durable for my Ghostie. It is a good size for a smaller/medium sized dog but definitely not good for puos that still have their deciduous(milk/needle)teeth and not for even light to moderate chewers due to the material on the chest. That's what made Ghost tear his up. He nicked it with his teeth, a hole formed and that was apparently his cue to rip the squeaker out & tear the poor toy to shreds-He did have fun doing it tho. Haha. For some dogs this toy might be great fun. It is definitely a great brand and the jumbo version is Ghost's fave toy of all time. Pricing on all of MultiPet's dog toys are amazing and I hope they stay that way! We keep several of the Jumbo Lambies here in case one \"goes swimming\" so we can wash it and he has one to carry/cuddle or in case one gets left somewhere cuz he wants to take it everywhere we go.",
