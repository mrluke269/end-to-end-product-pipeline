I went with the medium for my 80lb retriever pup & she worked it over in 3 days, but still loves the aftermath for tug of war. She made into the squeaky heart on day 3 - but hey, that\u2019s to be expected with her. For the price I can\u2019t complain. I\u2019m going with the large next; I can afford one every couple weeks for the peace of mind & entertainment value!",

She loves squeaking it and is able to do so easily; it has a \"grunt\" squeaker and a \"normal\" squeaker, so lots of sounds to be made. She is also able to catch it well during playtime, which I am kind of surprised about since it is a pretty large toy. Two paws up from my pup!",

You can press it's back in and it makes a lifelike grunting sound. It also squeaks but not like a hedgehog, however it is a pet toy. Pet lovies hold up better than many regular stuffed animals and are made for rough treatment making it perfect for a rough and tumble 9 yr old. My grandson just stared at it after opening and then carried it around for over half an hour and gently put it down to run off and play with his brothers.",

I gave this to my dog and then stupidly left the room for a moment thinking there\u2019s no way he could get it open because it\u2019s very well made. When I returned, he had already ripped the seams along the top and pulled out part of the stuffing to get to the mechanism that was making the sounds! I shoved the stuffing back in and sewed it together as best I could but there was no saving the sound maker. Now he ignores it and it sits forlornly in the toy box. Great for puppies and dogs that aren\u2019t so curious to figure out what is making that sound!",

Der R\u00fccken w\u00fcrde wieder gen\u00e4ht und die F\u00e4den entfernt und somit wieder voll einsatzf\u00e4hig .
