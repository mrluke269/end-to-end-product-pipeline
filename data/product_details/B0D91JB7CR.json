        "review_title": "Dog Breeder Review: Fantastic crate, identical to more expensive ones",
        "review_comment": "I was hesitant to buy this crate because I saw some of the negative reviews and as a disabled person, I was worried that I would have trouble managing the latches, but it was on sale and then had a coupon and so my roommate and I both bought one of these crates. Both of the crates came in fantastic condition. They were in boxes that were dented so I was a bit worried but the crates were in perfect condition. The latches work smoothly, unlike one of the reviews stated. I have bought dozens of crates in the past because I breed a luxury type of golden retriever. With every puppy I sell I send a crate home with them. In fact I crate train my puppies before they leave. So as you can imagine getting crates inexpensively that are still quality is important to me. The picture is of a 4.5 month old golden retriever that I moved from a 30 inch crate where his head and his butt were touching both ends and he couldn\u2019t sit up straight to this 42 inch crate which should last him for life. It\u2019s gonna be a great size for him to grow into. His mom doesn\u2019t even like crates and as soon as I set this up, she went inside of it before he did which was kind of funny. I realize that doesn\u2019t really say anything about the crate but clearly she thought it was a good crate too. If you\u2019re seeing little prongs on the top of it, that\u2019s just the divider that I set on top of it. My dog is potty trained so there is no need for me to use it. One of the reviews complains that the dividers tips were metal. I have to tell you, out of all the crates I\u2019ve bought in my lifetime I\u2019ve never seen one where the divider tips weren\u2019t metal. The secret to ensuring that your dog doesn\u2019t fishhook their eyes or another part of their body on these is that once you put the dividers in you use pliers and you pinch them. This does mean that if you have to move the divider or take it out then you have to open it with the pliers again, but that\u2019s the way to safely put them in. Also, I want to tell people about a little hack that you can do with these crates, which is awesome if you need a bigger crate or want to put two dogs in a crate you can remove one of the end panels by opening up the little hooks on the bottom and then you can zip tie two different crates together at the end. This makes one long crate and it\u2019s something that I did for puppies as they were being crate trained, and were transitioning from being able to be together all the time to being alone in a crate. It works great. Doesn\u2019t permanently damage the crate you just open the hook slightly push down on the side of the door. The door comes off. You do that on both crates. You remove the doors and store them somewhere safe and then later on you can put them back on and tighten the hooks back up with pliers and it doesn\u2019t damage them. It doesn\u2019t make them weak. I did see that some of the people that left reviews got this as a free item and man I wish I would\u2019ve been here for that. But I don\u2019t mind paying what I did for it and I wouldn\u2019t mind paying a little bit more without the coupon. This is literally the exact same as the crate that I had him in before, just a different brand and actually the crate I had him before cost me just as much as this one did and was only 30 inches and came bent. Different brand entirely but this crate is exactly the same but did not come bent. This one fit better in the box it came in too. You won\u2019t be disappointed in this crate.",

If you want your dog to have more room to move around I would go with the next size up. I got the 24 inch.
