She also struggled with a case of pancreatitis. With some lifestyle changes things got better. But then all of a sudden we noticed she was having allergic reactions to the dry food we had been feeding her prior which was another weight management food by another brand. When I looked at the bag I realized they had changed their formula and did not advertise it on the bag and it contained one of the ingredients she is allergic to. I was hesitant to go back to hills science diet because she did not like it the very first time we tried it however this time she absolutely loves it. She has been high energy, enjoys the taste ( if she can even taste it she's like a Hoover) and her bowel movements are much better. Purchasing it on Amazon was much cheaper than getting it from the vet. Overall this is a quality dog food that I suggest to anyone whose dog is having health problems as Hill science diet has different types of dry food for all kinds of problems like chronic diarrhea or overall health problems and aging. The ability to start out with a 4 lb bag to see how she would handle it as opposed to a 75 lb bag from my vet is amazing. This also costs much less than big pet store retailers.",

However, this breed tends to be prone to weight gain. So this choice of food was perfect. Since I use it, the vet always comments on how well she is doing with her weight. The ingredients are also good. Friends of mine who prefer to use more natural sources see no difference in their dogs' results compared with mine, and this diet. Coat, weight, etc. When she does #2, the size and texture are just those of a healthy dog. I like to dump it into a canister to keep it dry, but the size of the pellets makes it easy to pick and always have the right measurement for her weight.",

In 6 months. After approximately 3 weeks back on, I can see a difference just in the way he looks, and no stomach issues. He was 135 lbs at the vets office and he suggested I put him back on Hills perfect weight as he had gained so much weight. This food does work. He is energetic and is looking like the weight is coming off.",

He had prescriptions for carprofen and glucosamine to help with joint pain. Unfortunately, none of it made a noticeable difference\u2014he remained chunky, lethargic, and in constant discomfort. After switching to Hill's Perfect Weight, everything changed. He finally lost weight and I didn't have to cut the amount of food he was getting. He no longer needs daily pain medication, only taking it occasionally as needed, and his energy has significantly increased. I will warn you, though, the food has a very strong smell!",
