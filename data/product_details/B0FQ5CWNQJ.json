        "review_comment": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this kennel for my 50-pound Australian Shepherd, who is crate-trained. I also have a 30-pound terrier mix, who is not crate-trained but still likes to wander in and stand inside sometimes. My Aussie only stays in his kennel when no one is home because he and my cat do not get along, so I wanted to upgrade his old kennel with a new one, because his old one had started to rust. Setting it up is very quick and easy I set it up by myself in under 1 minute. It just unfolds, locks into place, and it is ready to use. The metal is not as thick as his previous kennel. I noticed the side with the extra door feels a bit looser compared to the other three sides. With enough pressure on the door, it can open slightly more than expected even when locked. But, since I keep that side pushed up against the wall, it does not bother me. I also noticed the roof of it slightly caves it some. The size is perfect for medium and large dogs. My Aussie has plenty of space to sit, stand, stretch, and even lay on his back with his legs in the air, which is his signature napping position. The tray on the bottom can be locked in place but slides out easily for cleaning. The material feels a little on the cheaper side. I have had trays crack in other kennels before around the 2-year mark, so time will tell how this one holds up. It does wipe clean easily and has not absorbed any odors so far. It is not overly heavy but bulky enough that it is easier to move with two people. It does come with a handle, but I find it more comfortable to drag it when moving it myself. When folded down, it becomes surprisingly flat and portable, which is nice for travel or storage. The best part is how quickly my Aussie made it his own. As soon as I set it up, he walked right in, laid down, and took a nap. It is clearly comfortable and familiar to him, which makes me feel better. It is a good-looking, practical kennel that works well for the price.",

For a wire cage the quality seems very good, she will jump at the door when she\u2019s excited to come out and it has held up well. If you have a dog that is completely determined to get out and they pushed with all their might they could probably bend it enough to break the door open. But so far it\u2019s held up quite will for our girl though all her jumping and pushing at the door when it\u2019s time to come out. The latches can be a pain to open and close, you have to wiggle them a lot. When not in use it does fold up quite easily, which has come in handy for moving to different rooms.",
