        "review_comment": "The Chuckit! Ultra Ball has quickly become my dog\u2019s favorite toy. These medium-sized balls are the perfect size for my 55-pound shepherd mix, and they hold up incredibly well to heavy chewing and nonstop games of fetch. The rubber is super durable and has just the right amount of bounce to keep my dog engaged and excited. One of the best features is that they float in water, which makes them ideal for beach or pool play. They also fit perfectly in the Chuckit! launcher, making long-distance throws effortless. Having a pack of four is a bonus since we keep one in the car, one at home, and extras just in case. These balls have outlasted every other toy we\u2019ve tried. Highly recommend for active dogs who love to fetch!",

        "review_comment": "We have five Border Collies. Each likes a specific type ball. We have TONS of tennis balls that easily go by the wayside after a round of fetch. This ball is durable, has a squeaker that actually works after a ton of play, is a great size and texture, cleans up well and is worth the price. This is a great tool in your arsenal for those dogs that are super hard on a tennis ball or who really love the squeaker. They are pricey, but they are worth it if you take care to wipe them up after play and put them away until the next use. Heavy chewers could make short work out of them if left out, but it would be somewhat difficult to quickly chew them up (always watch your dog with toys for safety). One of our favorite purchases for our crew.",
