      "\u3010Can Play On Any Floor\u3011The powerful motor enables the interactive cat ball toy to move quickly on thick carpets, thin carpets, and hard floors. However, the movement speed on carpets is slightly slower than that on hard floors. If you notice a significant slowdown in running speed compared to before, follow the instructions to clean the hair on the connecting rod",
      "\u3010Skin-friendly Material\u3011The surface of the ball is made of flocking and silica gel. The fluffy touch makes cats willing to get close to it. The 2.3-inch size is suitable for adult cats and kittens. You can regularly wipe the dirt on the surface of the toy ball",
      "\u3010Two Interaction Modes\u3011Press and hold the button for 1 second to activate the slow mode (the red light flashes and then turns off). It is suitable for timid, less active, or older cats. We have specifically turned off the light for these cats to avoid scaring or harming their eyes. Press the button again briefly to switch to the fast mode (the blue light is on continuously). This mode is applicable to all surfaces such as carpets and hard floors and is ideal for bold and energetic adult cats",
      "\u3010Interesting Tail Accessory\u3011The elastic tail accessory and the ball move quickly together, making cats think this is an agile mouse and go crazy for it. In the package, we have included two tail accessories for your convenience to replace",
      "\u3010Motion Activatied\u3011After the cat toy is turned on and you play with your cat for 3 minutes, it enters standby mode. When your cat pats or touches it again, it will be reactivated to play with your cat for another three minutes. During each activation, a bird chirping sound will be emitted to attract cats to chase and catch, stimulating their hunting instincts",
      "\u3010Rechargeable\u3011The electric ball has a built-in 600mAh rechargeable battery. It is recommended that you use a mobile phone charger and the Type-C USB cable included in the package to charge the interactive cat toy. There is no need to purchase additional batteries",
      "\u3010Warm Tip\u3011The electric ball toy is not waterproof. Please use the damp cloth (included) to clean the dirt on the surface. If you receive a defective ball or encounter any problems during use, please contact our after-sales team. We will surely satisfy you"

They do not take a long time to charge up. I have not used the fast speed but the slow feed is pretty fast. It zips all over and changes directions.

My two older cats (6y and 4y) are absolutely annoyed by our 4 month old kitten always chasing them and trying to play. I\u2019ve gotten her several cat toys now but she keeps losing them! I have no idea where they end up. And poor Zafina looks so sad when no one will play with her. We got this yesterday though and I turned it on and she\u2019s gone wild for it. I left it on for her when I went to bed and she was still chasing it around when I got up this morning. I turned it off and she\u2019s was swatting at it trying to get it going again. I\u2019m amazed it doesn\u2019t need to be charged yet. The little chirping sounds get my older cats interested in it too. All three of them have been stalking this thing since I set it to the high speed setting. It has not gotten stuck anywhere, but my kitten will pin it down and it tries to shake itself loose from her hold. It has no problem on our rugs as well as the wood floors. I would consider this an amazing value for the price. Not only does it entertain the cats but it does what I was hoping it would do: save my toes and give some peace for my older cats.",

        "review_comment": "I swear this this is ALIVE! LOL!!!! OK so yah if your cats are timid start off with the low setting. Our mother and son rescue kitties love toys but this was their first moving/noisy toy. Mama is more timid and it took a while for her to do more than just sit and watch it. The kitten and her would sit and watch it-- that was entertaining to us! We were glad that it was even holding their attention! But now the kitten chases it around and does summersaults around with it. Mama will even pick it up by its \"tail\" and has rescued it with it gets stuck. Yes it gets stuck under things. Sometimes the ball can shake itself loose and sometimes it needs help. It will roll to the same spots. I wonder if it's part Roomba how it does that. It even rolls around my feet like the kitten and seems to hide in/behind things. Its weird! Lol! I'm glad it comes with an extra tail but I wish it was stronger. The (petals/feathers?) were the first thing to fall off. The net part got a hole in it so I removed the bell before they could swallow it. The poofy balls get caught on stuff and so the tail is way stretched out. But oh well. They don't care. Hair does get stuck around where it spins and it is a bit hard to get it out from under the button area. Then I always hit the button putting the clear piece back on. Lol. When it does get lost, you can still find it if it's making noise. If the lights are off in the room you may see its occasional blinking. But I do love that it turns off until its mived again so I can leave it out. I wish we could whistle or something and have it chirp to find it easier. Or a remote. Haha. But if you forget about it, trust your cats will find it and wake you up at 5am playing with it! Lol! The cats do love it so it's definitely worth the money! Charging it is quick and convenient. I have to hide it in a drawer when I charge it, but the kitten knows exactly where it is and will sit on the drawer and paw at it. So kitty approved! Edit: As of June 2025: They wore it down already! The orange cover half came on but I used some non toxic glue to put it back on. Ordered more tails and one had to be glued at the base out of the box. Motor has slowed but they'll still watch it and sometimes attack it. They preferred the fast speed so I will have to buy a new one (or 2 lol) and retire the other. Still worth it for all the playtime they got out of it!",

        "review_comment": "I like this toy a lot. Bought it over 2 months ago. My cats (about 2 years old) love to watch it and chase it; they will be captivated for hours. It is not too loud, or too heavy. One of my cats is normally timid and anxious about unusual noises or movement - but she really likes this ball toy. The charge lasts for approximately 6 hours or so and it comes with a USB cable for charging. I let it loose about twice a week so they don't burnt out on it. It makes occasional chirping noises moves kinda random, and pauses for minutes at a time. It has 2 modes I think, the second being a little faster and longer bursts. It hardly ever gets stuck on anything so I rarely have to move it back into the open area. I bought the accessory pack with extra tails but have not needed it so far. It comes with 2 tails and we are still using the first one and its holding up well considering they bite and claw it a lot.",

        "review_comment": "So far works great. I have a timid cat and the slow mode is good for her. I really wish there was an option to turn off the \"simulated bird song\". It is a loud robotic chirping that goes off every 30 seconds or so anytime the toy is activated on both the fast and slow mode. It's loud enough to wake you up or annoy housemates and makes it so I have to locate the toy and make sure it is off every night so that the cat cannot activate the loud chirping in the middle of the night.",
