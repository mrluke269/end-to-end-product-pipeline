        "review_comment": "Love them, and more importantly, my cat loves them! I've bought toys like this in the past, but the past ones were super short, far more fragile and had only 1 toy for the same price. These are sturdy, very long, have multiple toys in case one breaks or gets worn out and has a clip on the end so you can attach pretty much any cat toy you want to it. I especially love how long the wand and string is. With the short ones I've bought in the past, you have to be pretty close to your cat to play, and I don't always wanna be sitting in the floor, or sitting in a chair leaning over to be able to play with my cat. With these, I can sit back on the couch and even recline after a long day of work and still be able to play with my cat and give her the exercise she needs without tiring myself out in the process. (You can also collapse the wand if you do wanna be closer or are playing in a smaller area) I'm confident these will last a long time, especially with as many toys it comes with to clip on the end, but I will definitely be ordering more. I wanna make sure I have plenty of these around for the foreseeable future to play with my baby and be able to relax after a long day of work at the same time. The only thing I would say to be careful about is the little metal clip on the end. Sometimes my cat catches the hook and I can't pull it away from her without possibly yanking at her claw. I definitely don't wanna hurt my sweet girl, so be careful and don't yank it too hard if they catch it, but I think that applies to any toy. As long as you're not reckless and yanking really hard at the toy while they have it caught, there will be zero issues. 10/10 would recommend.",

Have paid a LOT more for a lot less .... a priced right assortment to keep most kittens and cats entertained. Also you can hook other feathers or toys to the wand as it has an easy metal closure - not sure what it\u2019s called but great for attaching other not included toys ---- but seriously the 'worms' will delight for Hours and hours and especially at 4 am . . . but hey not complaining . .. .

The only downside is that the fishing line on the end can get caught in a robot vacuum very easily. The first wand simply snapped when that happened, but the second one splintered. That\u2019s when I discovered the wands are made of fiberglass. When I picked up the broken pieces, I ended up with tiny fiberglass splinters in my fingers that were very difficult to remove. The toys themselves are fantastic for playtime, but if a wand breaks, handle it with care to avoid fiberglass splinters. Just something to keep in mind before purchasing.",

So far, I've used only one of the feather attachments and cat already destroyed two feathers out of it (1 remaining on it) but I guess these toys won't last forever with how cats play. One thing is for sure it will last a good amount of time with everything that is included.",

        "review_comment": "The wands are collapsable so they're easy to store, and have enough flex to vary the flight of the feather or worm toys. The feather toys are fine, but I noticed they don't have a twirl to their movement, probably because the feathers are a bit soft. The worms make for a great distraction, but my cats have a hard time biting them. My only big complaints are that the lobster clasps are small, so those with big hands might have trouble opening them. And my cats can still see the fishing line despite it being somewhat transparent - I have to be careful they don't get cuts from the line. Still recommend these for at least the collapsable wands.",
