However, the durability and chewability receive mixed feedback - while some say it lasts a long time and is good for aggressive chewers, others report it tears apart quickly and isn't suitable for heavy chewers. Moreover, customers disagree on the hardness, with some appreciating the texture while others find it too hard. Additionally, the weight is criticized as being ridiculously heavy, and opinions on value are divided between those who find it worth the price and those who consider it a waste of money.",
