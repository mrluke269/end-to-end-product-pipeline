        "review_comment": "Bought this crate to keep blackbirds, grackles, groundhogs, and the local squirrels from hogging the oilers and peanuts. Within 30 minutes the tufted titmice, chickadees, nuthatches, and various sparrow species had figured it out. They are busy flitting in and out grabbing the seeds and nuts. The bar spaces on this crate are perfect size for smaller birds. Eastern Bluebirds and Carolina Wrens are also able to enter the crate. The Blue Jays, Red-bellied Woodpeckers and Mourning Doves can't enter, but there's plenty for them at the other feeders. They are larger and can muscle in with the squirrels and blackbirds. Crate was super easy to set up. No tools required, anyone can do this. Just slide it out of the box and start lifting the panels. You'll see that the main sides fold up into a rectangle. The ends then are folded up and snapped into place. Door has top and bottom latches. More than adequate to prevent squirrels from figuring out how to open the crate door. And if they do, a wire or carabineer will secure it easily. It took longer to carry the packaged crate 100 feet to the patio than to set it up. Seems well built for our purpose. Cannot attest to dog, cat, bunny, etc pet use. We have an AC cover to keep the snow/ ice off the crate (we live in upper Great Lakes). We don't expect the crate to last forever as we are leaving it outside. It looks like it will still last several years outdoors, especially if we cover it. Curious raccoons may investigate so we'll be sure to empty the pan before dark. Fortunately, no Black Bears in our area. We really like that the pan is convenient to slide in and out and it is made of a resin material. Very sturdy. We are impressed so far with the crate. For the price, it's a good buy and helpful addition to our bird feeding hobby.",

I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee and this fit in the back of the cargo area without having to fold down the rear passenger seats. I still have room to put other things back there, and I'm hoping my cat will be ok with it. He is acclimating in the house right now with tempting treats and Also, I was able to place a standard carpet sample (from the carpet store) and it fits on the plastic base perfectly. Unpacking this and putting together was like 2 minutes, and it's about 12 lbs max so I was able to pull it out of the box with one hand. Now I'm a little pissed that I didn't get the Amazon \"big price\" of $31 they had on for today, but I'm sure I could call and they would adjust it. Another nitpick- they said it was to have been delivered yesterday, so in usual fashion their delivery service is not in keeping with their promise. No biggie, really, but if you say you are going to do something, do it. Especially since you just cut back on prime membership. This seems like it will be a good investment for a \u201cfraidy\u201d cat.",

Resistente, llevo 2 semanas us\u00e1ndola y no se ha deformado ni despostillado. Uno de los pastores es escapista y no ha logrado salirse de la jaula. En caso de que lo necesites, trae una reja extra para hacer una divisi\u00f3n adentro de la jaula. Hay que monitorearla si quieres tener un buen precio, hay variaciones de vez en cuando. La soluci\u00f3n a muchos problemas cuando tienes una raza inquieta.",

Stopping the dog eating all his food was a problem so I did some research and this came up trumps. It has two doors which makes life easier for me, I can put food in the side door and the end door stays open for the cat to go in. I\u2019ve positioned it so the greedy dog can\u2019t get her head in, works brilliantly. It\u2019s really well made and comes with a separate divider which would create two very small areas, ideal for transporting tiny dogs, cats or rabbits or as a safe feeding station for old cats \ud83d\ude0a",

Havign said that, this is a good crate, as far as I know about crates. Medium size dog fits in easily. It is guit spacious. It is stil la torture, which can take me easily to my openning remarks, but go for it if you already made a mistake having a dog.",
