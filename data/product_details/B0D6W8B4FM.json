        "review_comment": "So many functions in one little device! Not only is it a perfect cat toy it is also useful around the home/office. It has 3 lighting modes: a red dot for cat play or at the office to enhance presentations; Purple for checking cat skin health/finding spills or urine in the carpet or Checking cash to see if it's real or fake; and white as a mini flashlight. It also has a little switch you can scroll to select 5 red patterns: dots, smiles, mouse, stars, & butterflies. The variety of patterns keep your cat's interest to play. I bought it because my cat is overweight and I need to exercise him. I'm impressed with the engineering. My favorite function is that you can charge it directly with the built in USB. No expensive batteries needed. It also has a short rope attached to hang it and not lose it. I have bought several of these for my cat, extended family pets, the office, my vehicle and at home. I also like to take it . The flashlight is useful of course to get around in the dark and the laser pointer is kind of cool to point out Stars. So many uses and it's durable. I've dropped mine several times and it always functions with no problems. You can't beat the price either. Be sure to play it safe and never point it at an animals/human eyes and definitely don't point it at an airplane or helicopter you can blind them.",

        "review_comment": "The laser pointer has a metal body, is nice and bright red, has cute shapes of a mouse, butterfly, star, smiley face and a red dot about the size of a pea and it looks larger from 20ft away about the size of a nickel but stays bright. The other shapes also enlarge when shining the laser light from a distance and stay bright, clear and well defined. My cats absolutely love this toy and go bananas when we grab it from the drawer and it keeps their attention. The button to turn it on to select between red laser, purple black light, and white flash light and to the off position is a plastic sliding type and located about the middle of the shaft. A separate plastic, horizontal rotating selector knob is near the top of the shaft to change the shapes of the laser, so easy to use with one hand. I have only had it about a week, but I haven't had to charge it yet so I don't know how long the battery will last. It came already charged and ready to go out of the package. It seems to be good quality and it also has a purple light that acts as a black light for checking kitties skin for ringworm and other fungal skin conditions and for detecting cat urine. Of course to use it that way you have to shine the purple light in the dark. It also has a white light that can be used as a mini flashlight which can be helpful for emergencies. It has a metal clip on it as well so you could clip it to a pocket if you want to carry it with you. There is a metal cap with a mini lanyard strap attached that can be pulled off for access to the usb-a connector which is used to charge this device. You can plug it in to the usb power port on a computer or other powered usb ports available. I like this rechargeable laser pointer much better than past ones I've bought that use button cell batteries. It seems to be a good quality product so far and the price was reasonable.",

Functionality is its strong suit, offering multiple light modes and patterns to keep cats engaged. The best feature is its USB charging, which eliminates the need for batteries, making it more eco-friendly and convenient. \u200bIn terms of quality, it has a durable stainless steel casing that holds up well to rough play. Ease of cleaning is simple\u2014just wipe it down with a soft, wet cloth. At a good value for money, this toy is an excellent, long-lasting solution for keeping indoor cats active and entertained.",

        "review_comment": "This thing been such a hit in our house! I originally bought it as an interactive toy for our cats (and now our dogs), but the real surprise was how much fun my toddler has \u201chelping\u201d with it too. The adjustable patterns are perfect and fun. Our cats and dogs go nuts chasing the light, and my toddler giggles nonstop while changing the settings and watching the cats and dogs zoom around. It\u2019s turned into a bonding activity that entertains them all, which honestly is priceless. I also love that it\u2019s rechargeable. We use it almost every day, and I never have to worry about constantly replacing batteries. The build feels sturdy enough to handle excited little hands that occasionally throw it, and it\u2019s safe and easy to use. I\u2019ve bought plenty of cat and dog toys that get ignored after a day, but this one has stayed a favorite. Our cats and dogs gets their exercise, my toddler gets to \u201cplay director,\u201d and we get a few quiet minutes to enjoy the show. Totally worth it and highly recommend for any household with pets and kids!",
