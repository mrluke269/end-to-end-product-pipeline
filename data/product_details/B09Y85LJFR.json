The worms always get my cat going. They shred apart after a little while but it's nice and cheap so it's expected I just buy replacements whenever I need them. Hanging toy is just a ball for him he loves it. When I am going out for a weekend I hang this up and it tires him out he'll play with it so much. It has lots of elastic in it to bounce around everywhere. The yellow strings are okay I put toys on the end and hooked them up to the ceiling so he can play and they didn't last very long before it started to string out. I am very impressed with these toys the value of it is absolutely worth the cheap price.",

        "review_comment": "I never write reviews, but this definitely needed one. TLDR - absolutely worth buying, great quality, great variety. You get a combination of toys where you\u2019re involved with the playing as well as independent playing for your cat. The wands- My 4 year old cat loves a good wand and his last one finally wore out (more like he ripped off all the feathers. It was a decent wand, but it didn\u2019t collapse/shrink down like these do which is so incredibly helpful. I didn\u2019t even know I needed that. If we didn\u2019t find a place to hide the old one, he would find it and drag it all around the house. It was cute, but not at 4 am. This one easily stores in drawers when we need it to. I love that there\u2019s a variety of different attachments. He gets bored with the same thing after a while. Also worth mentioning that the string hanging off the pole is very light colored which helps them not realize that I\u2019m the one manipulating the toy, making it feel like more of a real hunt for him! The door hanging bungee- I\u2019ll be honest, when I first order this I was not expecting it to work or be anything special. I only got this pack because of the price and variety. But I was wrong. The part to hangs at the top of the doorframe is not loose like I thought it would be, it hasn\u2019t fallen or got pulled off yet (which is a miracle). Only thing I would comment on is that my lil guy ripped through that bungee cord in less than 4 hours. I don\u2019t think this was because of poor quality though. I think my cat just absolutely loved it and went to town on it. No joke, he was fully entertained all by himself with it. I can easily tie it back up so he can play with it again. It is really helpful for him to have something to keep his attention while I work from home. Overall, great product, great variety, so much fun.",

        "review_comment": "Got this for our foster kittens. Pros: - they love all the toy attachments - the wands telescope from the size pictured out to about 3 times in length. Great for adding versatility (if I'm sitting with them the short length is comfortable, but fully extended if I'm standing) and also for efficient storage. - our situation isn't appropriate for using the doorway attachment, but I gave it to a friend who has cats of her own and she says her cats love it. Cons: - nylon monofilament (fishing line) is used on the wands and kittens easily bit through it in their first play session. I replaced it with thin cord. - the \"worm\" looking toy attachments easily shred and are torn apart. The kittens love these, but I had to monitor them to make sure they didn't swallow any shreds. One worm lasted 2 days (4 play sessions) with my two, 6wk old siblings. Overall, I am very happy with this. The wand toys aren't meant to be left with the kittens unsupervised anyway, so when I saw the fishing line being bitten and the \"worm\" toys being torn apart, I just replaced/removed them. I don't re-use toys from one foster group to another (I will re-use the wands), so for this price and considering in my situation they are disposable anyway, I am very happy with this.",

        "review_comment": "Wands so far are great, however strings, door clamp, and attachment toys are not durable and could pose a safety hazard for your cats. These wand toys are great to keep my cats playing. However, after only having it a couple of weeks, the worms are shedding at their ends and falling apart, which can be dangerous because my cats can ingest the \u201cfur\u201d. The little purple rabbit fell apart too and chunks of the fur yarn was falling out so it no longer has a head no longer and I\u2019m afraid the cats could eat that too, so all of those went in the trash. All I have left are the two feathers which also follow apart easily. Also, the yellow string to attach to the wand unravels, so I had to burn the ends to stop it from falling apart. The clamp that goes around the door frame barely fits if you have moulding, and I\u2019ve already lost the rubber safety covers that help hold on the door frame. Unfortunately this set is not very durable, but was so inexpensive, I guess it\u2019s to be expected. At least I still have the wands, I can try to attach some other toys (that I\u2019ve had for years) to them.",

It comes with multiple attachment and they are super quite and the rod doesn\u2019t break no matter how much weight from your cat biting it!
