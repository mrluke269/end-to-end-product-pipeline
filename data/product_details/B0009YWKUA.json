The first thing I noticed was the ingredient list with real chicken as the first ingredient, no by product meals, and no corn, wheat, or soy. That gave me confidence, it was starting on the right foot. \ud83d\ude42 My dog took to it right away, no hesitation at the bowl, and the transition from his old food was smooth. After about a week his coat looked shinier and his energy stayed consistent without any stomach issues. The kibble size was easy for him to chew and I liked that the bag was resealable which kept it fresh. \ud83d\ude42 The only drawback is the price. It is on the higher end for a kibble in this size and I know there are other brands that offer similar nutrition for less. That said the quality feels solid and the trial bag is a smart way to test it out before making a bigger investment. \ud83d\ude42\u2764\ufe0f",
