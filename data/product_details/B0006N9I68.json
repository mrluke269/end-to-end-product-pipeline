The moment I bring it out, she\u2019s alert, playful, and ready to pounce. What makes it great is how it mimics real prey movement\u2014she gets a full workout chasing it around, and it keeps her entertained way longer than other toys. No batteries, no noise, just pure fun. If you\u2019re tired of buying fancy toys that your cat ignores, give this one a shot. It\u2019s the only toy my cat consistently loves, and it\u2019s become part of our daily play routine.",

When our oldest cat was a kitten, she would play so hard with this thing that she would wear herself out, and even now both she and my three-legged cat absolutely love it, it's their favorite toy. It could entertain these cats for hours if I let them. If I could give this toy 6 stars, I would. It's so simple, and so cheap, yet so effective. Will absolutely keep buying these for any cats I wind up with in the future. 11/10.",

        "review_comment": "I've worked in 3 cat shelters and 2 cat kennels, and these are the one thing that you'd five in all five locations. These are magic. I've handled hundreds of cats and kittens, and this is the number one toy I reach for. There's a few big reasons why this toy is great. 1) You can use both sides of it. Feel shy kitties that are easily overstimulated you can use the back side with the single cardboard roll. 2) the movement from the spring steel perfectly bounces around in a way that cats find interesting and also minimize the amount of work you have to do. You can largely hold it still and the cat will bounce it around on their own, making extended playtime sessions as easy as just holding the Dancer. I'll even close one end in a drawer and let the other size hang out and the kitty will play with it without you even having to be there. 3) This is a big one: cats secretly just love trash. Hairties, boxes, ball of tape, balls of paper, paper bags, ziptie, etc. Cats will always choose random trash over a fancy toy, and this toy simulates that by being made with trash, which I say with absolute love in my heart because cats ALWAYS choose this toy over others, and this is priced to match the materials. It's always seemed like the only toy where the creator paid attention to what cats actually like and not what they think humans will think is cute. So again, its: Cheap Loved by cats above any other toy Simulates chasing a bug Very active play Requires minimal work from the human Sold literally anywhere cat stuff is Recommended by every feline professional Do your kitty a favor and buy like 6 of these. This is easily the best cat toy ever made and they cost like no money. As a cat professional, I guarantee your cat will love this to death.",

        "review_comment": "Our cat, Gremlin, has recently been kind of ignoring her other three wand type toys but she\u2019s only about a year old and has a lot of energy so she\u2019s been a bit of a menace. And has been attacking our toes. A lot. I got her this toy because about ten years ago I recall having purchased this for my sister\u2019s cats and them loving it. The verdict has been reached: People, this is the best $4 I have ever spent on my cat! She is going absolute nutty over this thing!! Backflips, somersaults, and aerial ambush attacks all included lol. I think this toy\u2019s wiggling, bouncing motion is really what makes all the difference. Gremlin has been super excited the handful of times an unfortunate fly has gotten into our house. She stalks and smacks this toy just like she does with flies. It also kind of bounces and wiggles like a flying insect when I hold it so I think that, plus the unpredictable way that it moves, keeps Gremlin very entertained! I will let it wiggle through the air but also drag it along the floor and across the couch etc to keep playtime varied and interesting. We\u2019ve had this toy for three days now and as a result all other toys are being ignored lol. Our cat seems to especially like chewing on the cardboard end of the toy. The small size of the cardboard lure seems to keep it from being overwhelming or intimidating for our kitty, who is known for ignoring large plushie style cat toys. The design of this toy is extremely simple but in its simplicity lies the brilliance. It catches our cat\u2019s attention without being overly complicated or bulky and the quality of the wire and cardboard seem good. The wire is pretty study so it maintains its shape but still springs back and forth easily. I can also appreciate that, just like the original I bought a decade ago, it\u2019s made in a US factory and a solar-powered one at that! At least, according to the tag :) I also appreciate that the packaging is minimal and with that it\u2019s reducing the amount of needless plastic waste. So, in summary this toy is cat-approved, easy to use, really inexpensive, well-made and eco friendly. This is definitely worth trying out for your cats!",

        "review_comment": "This toy is priced right for what it is -- coat hanger wire with a few bits of kraft paper attached. However, the effects of this trash mash-up are pure magic. The way the wire is bent and the way the papers are attached, it creates a bobbing, insect-like movement in the air and my cats are obsessed. There is something about the movement of the paper bits that unlock some sort of primal instinct to hunt fluttery things. My cats (7 months and 3 years old) will play with this thing longer than most other toys. It makes no sound, uses no batteries, requires almost no human effort to operate and provides massive play time bang for the buck. So far, the little paper bits have held up to much abuse, but it does appear that replacements can be had from the manufacturer. My cats love it so much that I told my parents to get one for their young cat and guess what... he also loves it. We even ended up buying a second one so two humans can entertain both cats at the same time (or one human using both hands).",
