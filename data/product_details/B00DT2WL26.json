I often hear the balls racing round the tracks in the middle of the night. Always makes me smile. Even our tripod cats enjoy the toy because they can lie down and still bat at all of the levels. This is the best ball track toy we have ever purchased. We have given several as gifts and donated a lot of them to various rescues. We would highly recommend this toy. FYI, there are quite a few cheaper versions of this ball track on the market, but this one is the sturdiest and the cats seem to like the bright yellow color best.",

        "review_comment": "The media could not be loaded. At first, like the previous reviewer mention you gotta push the balls. once the kitty gets accustomed to it after a couple of sniffs here and there, (which takes a total of 10 seconds lol) Then all hell breaks lose. I took the video about an hour ago and right now the kitty has already managed to turn it upside down and continuing to play with it in inverted-mode haha. It does have 4 rubber feet at the base so place it on something hard and it wont move around. (I just put mine on a towel for the sake of taking a video now, and it moves around when the kitty aggressively tries to maul the un-gettable balls to death) So place it on tile, wood, ceramic, anything hard that can make use of the rubber base. Moving on, the toy is wonderful. Its well-built and i tried physically asserting some force to the clip areas to test its strength and it seems sturdy enough! If i cant budge the clips with the force I used there is no way a cat can either. Its made of good quality plastic not the cheap kind you would normally expect in your head when it comes to these sorta(basically chinese made) products. It is made in China but seems to be produced and imported from the U.S.A. (I've attached a pic of it) More importantly, the kitty has been playing with it since i opened it, for an unhealthy amount of time, lol. so to make sure the kitty doesnt get bored of it, make sure you keep it stashed away somewhere for long periods and bring it out only occasionally as \"play time\" because every toy tends to get boring after a while. And you wont need to use catnip to make kitty play with things again. I rate it an easy 5/5 stars.",
