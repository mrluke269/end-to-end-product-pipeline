The toy is well worth its price and provides good exercise, with one customer noting it's a cost-effective solution for multi-cat households. However, the battery life and functionality receive mixed reviews - while some say it stays charged forever and works great, others report it doesn't last long and stops working well. Moreover, durability is a concern as the plastic clip breaks easily, and the movement pattern changes often but doesn't move as well as expected.",

I once found it under the bed in the dogs mouth. after collecting the pieces and thinking i would have to throw it away i was surprised to find that I could easily re assemble the pieces and snap them back together an wrap the tire around it and it worked great. I did have to 3D print a new tire, the dog chewed up the original pretty good.",

It's easy to charge, the power button is on the side, just hold down for a few seconds until you feel it vibrate then release. I wish it stayed on longer than 5 minutes though, because after 5 minutes it shuts off. 10-15 minutes would be ideal for my cat. The only other thing is its kinda loud, the little motor and it rolling around knocking into things and slamming into the walls before it turns around and heads back the other direction. Also it rolls under the furniture and gets stuck, you can hear the motor trying to move. So we have to grab it and throw it back out into the open again.",

Battery life is not that long, however it did surprise me being that it is a motor. The charging port is under a durable flap that doubles as a switch cover. It is soft enough that it doesn't hurt the cats or furniture when it runs into them, I had it go under a piece of furniture and it got stuck rolling back and forth until it worked its way out from under it. It turned out to be an item that will spend most of its life on a shelf, and that is a bit disappointing.",

        "review_comment": "Don\u2019t laugh I bought this as a gift for my neice\u2019s cats birthday \ud83d\ude02. I can\u2019t recommend it enough though!! Right out of the box I pushed the button, set it on the floor and it took off!! I am impressed by the amount of power it has. Even more than that though it seems to have a mind of its own. It doesn\u2019t get stuck in corners or under the couch it just turns itself around and heads the other direction! Kind of like a little rumba! The only thing that I don\u2019t love about it is if you have a long haired pet the hair will get stuck around the ball. It is easy enough to clean, though. It\u2019s rechargeable, with a good weight to it, I have a feeling it will last a long time! I will be ordering one for my own cats today!",

        "review_title": "Engaging toy buy recommend monitoring play",
        "review_comment": "Initially I was afraid this toy was too intense for my cat and would be a return as they initially hissed at it on first play attempt. However after I put the toy away in a drawer I found my cat pawing at the drawer wanting to get the toy out. It's now become a part of his daily play routine and a good tool for me to turn on for distracting him. That being said the toy does have some issues for our household that keep it from being a five star toy. I would advise owners to only use this toy while supervising their cat to assure the lure being used doesnt unravel or get swallowed by their cat. Watching play sessions is also important to assure you can monitor the location of the toy in case it gets stuck or you intended to keep it put away between play sessions. My cat primarily watches this toy and follows it around the house while it runs. 1. The attached lure/tail that is default attached falls apart easily. This lure is comprised of fine string giving a fur like spiral effect and while this style of lure was engaging and worked well with the toy for movement it quickly started to fall apart leaving little pieces of string in clumps around my house. This is a safety concern as my cat could have easily swallowed the string. Once this part of the toy starts to unravel it becomes very unsafe in my opinion. I do have an adult cat that enjoys aggressive play so at first I thought it was negligence on my part not closely monitoring play with the toy but watching play sessions after the initial discovery of strings being detached I continued to find small pieces of string that seemed to be organic decay rather than my cat removing them from the toy. There is a feather style lure that comes with the package that we switched to and have not had any new issues with it coming apart for safety. 2. This toy is very loud which can be a draw back or a benefit depending on your opinion. If the toy is on I know it's on, I can hear it's gears constantly working during a play session and while the noise isn't pleasant and might intimidate a cat it does make it easy to know the play session timed out or locate the toy if it's still running but stuck in an odd part of the house. 3. The toy struggles on my carpet. Our apartment has a mix of carpet and vinyl flooring. The toy is primarily used for play sessions on a carpeted area and needs an aggressive setting to assure it will be able to roll freely. However if it makes its way onto a section of the vinyl floor it will then turn into a shooting star zooming around at a high speed that can make it difficult to catch. 4. Play sessions are on the shorter side which could be a draw back. The toy doesn't run very long in my opinion when you turn it on but honestly I think that is for the best so that it doesn't accidentally travel too far and get stuck in an odd corner of the house. If it doesn't bump into obstacles it can still travel a fair distance for interactive play. I always start play sessions in the living room and have watched the toy maneuver its way to the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom of our home. 5. The toy can and for us regularly gets itself stuck. This thing almost acts like a it has a consciousness and will roll itself into an odd space that is literally just big enough for it to get into and get stuck. On more than one occasion I've had to get down on hands and knees to free it from under a desk or reposition it from a tight corner. This is might not be an issue if your cat is more interactive with the toy and will get it unstuck themselves (my cat really just watches the toy and follows it around the house).",
