The squeaker and chewing ability also get mixed reviews, with some loving the squeak while others say it's barely audible, and while some consider it good for aggressive chewers, others warn it's not suitable for heavy chewers. Value for money opinions are divided, with some finding it worth the price while others say it's not worth the money.",

I don\u2019t truly believe any toy is \u201crip/tear proof\u201d but I enjoyed spending the money to see him happy for those 20 mins. Very fun for my dog and he was ecstatic with his new toy.
