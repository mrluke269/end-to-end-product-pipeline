The rope quality receives positive feedback, with one customer noting its tight construction. The durability, size, and thickness receive mixed reviews - while some say it holds up longer than other toys and is good for large dogs, others find it doesn't last long and isn't suitable for really aggressive chewers. Value for money opinions are also mixed, with some finding it good value while others say it's not worth the price.",

        "review_comment": "My dog is very tough on toys -- in my house, the \"indestructible\" label just means it will last for hours instead of minutes. But these ropes survive. I have a 60 lb pitbull and a 19-year old son, and they use these ropes in the most intense tug-of-war you can imagine; which includes the dog biting one end and my son hold the other and the two spinning so fast that all four of her feet are off the ground. This has been going on for months with the same rope. It's getting worn down and chewed up, but it still holds. If it ever completely falls apart, we're getting another. Definitely worth the cost.",

        "review_comment": "My dog is the type of aggressive chewer that makes toy companies cringe. She can destroy a kong in under 48 hours, so when I say a toy is impressive, I mean it. These pictures are from after a month of constant play. We\u2019ve had these toy ropes for about a month, and as you can see from the photos, my pup is still very much attached to these toys. She has chewed and chewed and chewed on them. The ropes started the fraying process a few days after we got them, but they have stubbornly held on despite endless doggy toy abuse. They\u2019re about at the end of their lives now, but when I consider the cost to lifespan ratio, I am very pleased. I wasn\u2019t expecting the length of the ropes though. The one in the picture is the one that comes looped in half. It has been the preferred one by my pup, but I think it\u2019s because it is shorter than the other. The length of the other is so big compared to my girl that when she does the shake her head to kill thing, the knot on the other end whacks her in the back of the head. It\u2019s humorous. I ended up tying that one a second time in the middle just to shorten it up. I suggest these toys for larger dogs than mine, based on the length. However, the width of the chew toy is about right for my 30 pound pup, which does pose a bit of a conundrum. Overall, if your pup is an aggressive chewer and chew-tug player, and you aren\u2019t opposed to maybe tying an extra knot or two, this toy is great.",

These toys are perfect for tug-of-war and solo chewing sessions, keeping my dog entertained and active. The durable construction holds up well against aggressive chewing, and the cotton fibers help in maintaining dental hygiene by cleaning between teeth.
