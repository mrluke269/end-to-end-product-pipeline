        "review_comment": "The media could not be loaded. Cat toys: 1: is it worth it? 2: will they use it? 3: is it sturdy - will it last - hold up to nails/teeth? 1 - you decide for $13 2 - mine has kicking habits so they use the toy 3 - seems sturdy @4 months in Positives: I have 1 gray cat (12 yr old male) that plays with anything .. A N Y T H I N G and 1 black cat (7 yr old male) that only plays with red dot/flash lights, bugs and string - NO CAT TOYS - but he\u2019s seems to like this toy as long as the gray cat is also playing with one simultaneously. I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s because he sees him playing and is jealous (there\u2019s a lot of jealousy between these 2!) or if it\u2019s because the catnip attracts him and then he\u2019s hooked, or both. You can see both cats enjoy it. My gray cat is the one who likes to kick and has long rear nails (he plays very, very rough normally) and he enjoys the heck out of this toy. Even the big black cat will do an occasional kick with it. Negatives: The one thing is the little feather stuff. There\u2019s a few pieces that are longer (you can actually see it in one of the videos, the black cat playing with the green one it has a piece that's longer, and it goes across his face). My other gray cat eats anything. He\u2019s a total garbage disposal. He eats hair off the floor. He eats dust balls. He eats carpet pieces that have been picked up from their nails. Arg! I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s horrible. So, I am forever living with the behavior of cat/toddler proofing my home. If it could be picked up and put in the mouth or licked, it\u2019s bad. I know that\u2019s sad but it\u2019s the truth. So that\u2019s a negative because I picked up one of the pieces off the floor when they were new. And of course, the catnip doesn\u2019t stay for long. But I am getting the most life out of them as possible because I keep them in separate Ziploc baggies and don\u2019t let the air get to them when not in use. And last negative would be cost. I believe I paid $13 or so 11/27/23. When I replace these, since they don\u2019t last more than a few months before the catnip or the attraction portion of the play is gone from this toy, I\u2019ll be looking to replace them for at least, at minimum, 50% less than what I paid, or between $5-$7 tops. Notes: I keep/store these in a Ziploc plastic bag with the air removed (when not in use) and bring them out for a few minutes of play or until they\u2019re tired of it and then store it back in the baggie. So it seems to last longer I suppose. I bought this pack of 3 toys on 11/27/23 and they\u2019re just now getting to the point where I should be replacing them soon if I want them to enjoy the catnip portion as part of the toy. Overall. Good toy - sturdy, crinkly, decent cat-nippy smell, cats seem to enjoy them and their nails/teeth haven out any holes in them or scratched them apart. Also store them in a Ziploc baggie when not in use, the catnip part will last a bit longer. So if I\u2019m using a scale of 1-10 then maybe an 8-9 using my gray cat to measure because he loves to play normally and will play a long time due to the catnip. Also he has no teeth, so he slobbers on it, a lot, and I have to wait for it to dry before I can put it away in a baggie. Or it could just be because he plays with it so much more than the other cat that it\u2019s out of the Ziploc baggie more often, therefore, the catnip portion of it could be going away or not as strong. But he still plays with it and once I entice him, he really gets going with it.",

The kitten loves the sound of it and likes that she can comfortably kick it. I was surprised that my adult cat actually enjoyed it and it fit him so he too could bunny kick it. Nice and soft, you can smell the catnip inside, and makes that nice krinkly sound they like. I ended up cutting the tag off the one since they like eating tags. Would buy again if they happen to tear these up. So far so good, and again, they went to town right out of the package! A little sad the cuter colors are more expensive, but I know the cats don\u2019t care.",

        "review_comment": "I have two cats, a 7 year old male and a 16 year old female, and I confess I spoil them. They've had a lot of toys over the years, some they liked and some they just ignored. So when I gave them each one of these (they come in a set of three), and they both immediately were down on the floor bunny kicking, rolling around and generally having a great time, I knew we had a winner. The toys don't look like much, just a furry oblong that crinkles when squished, but the shape is just right for a cat to grasp between front and back legs and roll around, kicking, biting and even licking. Of course the catnip inside the toy helps a lot! Having purchased quite a few toys over the years that claimed to contain catnip, I can tell you that a lot of times the catnip inside has gotten old and doesn't have much aroma, but these had obviously fresh, good quality catnip inside. The set of three comes in a sealed plastic bag and the only aroma I could smell when I opened the bag was catnip. And the cats could really smell it as they were all over me, trying to help get the bag open so they could get at the toys. I've bought several other cat toys from this brand, Potaroma, and have had good success with all of them. The 7 year old still plays with one of the other toys every day and we've had that toy for over two years. So, good value for money (these little \"pillows\" are very inexpensive), and a good company for cat toy products.",

        "review_comment": "These Potaroma Cat Toy Pillows were an instant hit in my house. The moment I opened the pack, my cats were all over them. Each pillow is the perfect size for batting, tossing, and of course \u2014 bunny kicks! The material feels durable yet soft enough for them to cuddle with, and the catnip scent definitely got their attention right away. What I like most is that the pack comes with three pillows, so all my cats can play at the same time without fighting over just one. The designs are cute, and the toys seem to hold up well even after a lot of rough play. Pros: Strong catnip scent that keeps cats interested Durable fabric but soft enough to cuddle Perfect size for kicking, chewing, or carrying around Comes in a pack of three \u2014 great for multi-cat homes Cons: The catnip scent may fade over time, but that\u2019s normal for these types of toys Overall, these toys get two paws up from my furry crew. They\u2019re fun, durable, and a great way to keep cats entertained (and tired out). If your cat loves catnip, these are a must-try!",

The kickers are made of soft materials and make a pleasant crinkling sound yet they are really hard-wearing, because after a major workout by my cat on the first one it looked as good as new, despite being quite damp from all the biting and pulling. They also seem to be full of catnip as he was completely and utterly obsessed by it for the first couple of hours. I bought these to entertain my indoor cat and also for exercising his hind legs, but he is quite big lengthwise and these particular kickers are probably designed more for small or medium cats. Nevertheless I know he will love the 2nd one when I present it to him down the track a bit. I will probably give away the 3rd one to a friend who has a smaller cat as it will make a delightful gift.",
