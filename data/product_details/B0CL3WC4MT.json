It is surprisingly durable, holds up to tug-of-wars, and has lasted through several washes in the washing machine and dryer. It has crinkle stuff inside, so no real stuffing to come apart. The puppies are now 3 months and still love to play with this toy. The large is just the right size and they seem to love the crinkle noise. It's easy to grab and toss around. A great buy and has outlasted a bunch of other toys. Highly recommend.",

It\u2019s big enough to keep him interested but lightweight enough for him to carry, drag, and shake. He seems very attracted to the crinkle sound. There are several places he can easily grab hold to carry the toy. He likes to carry it around the room. It\u2019s a super cute toy. There is minimal stuffing in the head and beak and the eyes are embroidered, so I don\u2019t worry about him swallowing parts. He is an aggressive chewer for a puppy, and the toy hasn\u2019t come apart yet. It\u2019s the first toy he grabs when it\u2019s playtime.",

        "review_comment": "I bought two of the Best Pet Supplies Interactive Squeaky Dog Chew Toy\u2014Crinkle Duck (Yellow), Large\u2014for my beagle, who loves it so much he tears right through it, but he enjoys every second doing it, carrying even the defluffed remains around the house with pure joy. Design and Features: This large (about 11-inch) yellow plush duck features a squeaker for engaging sounds, crinkle material for texture, and long arms for tugging or shaking. Designed for small to large dogs, it has reinforced seams meant for chewing and a bright color for easy spotting during fetch games. The lightweight build suits indoor play without risking furniture damage. Performance and Engagement: My beagle goes crazy for the squeak and crinkle, pouncing on it with delight and carrying it everywhere\u2014his tail wags non-stop as he shakes it. The toy sparks such joy that even after he defluffs it within days, he proudly parades the tattered duck around the house like a prize. It\u2019s perfect for fetch or solo play, keeping him entertained for hours. I see the happiness it brings, making the quick destruction worthwhile. Durability and Value: Not tough enough for a beagle\u2019s aggressive chewing, it rips apart fast\u2014stuffing comes out in under a week\u2014but the affordable price makes replacing it no issue. The squeaker stays intact even post-destruction, adding to his obsession. It\u2019s safe with no loose small parts, and the value lies in the fun it delivers. Pros: Squeaky and crinkle features drive my beagle wild with joy. Lightweight for fetch and indoor play. Affordable for frequent replacements. Even defluffed, he loves carrying it around. Cons: Tears quickly under beagle-level chewing. Not durable for tough chewers long-term. Final Thoughts: This Crinkle Duck isn\u2019t tough enough for my beagle\u2019s relentless chewing, but his pure joy tearing through it and carrying the remains makes it a favorite. I love seeing his happiness, and I\u2019d recommend it for dogs who love playful destruction, knowing you\u2019ll need backups!",

I would say it's indestructible with that regard because after all this time it's still in one piece nothing's been torn off ripped off or anything. Probably due to the fact that it has no stuffing in it that has probably helped the cause. But I can't complain about a toy that's lasted this long after so many of the other ones were in pieces and or eviscerated after a week.
