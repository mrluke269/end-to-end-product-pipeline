It\u2019s always a gamble getting any cat toy and hoping they'll like it, so I was concerned about this one, but they\u2019ve had a similar type of toy in the past and enjoyed it. I put it away at night (because I\u2019m afraid my orange guy might chew off the string and then eat it), and I can tell both cats are waiting for me to take it out for them when I get up the next day. I love the way this toy is designed compared to similar types of toys. There are two layers of fabric with the moving parts in between, so the arm doesn't get tangled up in the fabric. The irregular pattern of the toy makes it more like a hide-and-seek game, which keeps them entertained. I appreciate that it's rechargeable, that it has multiple modes, and that I can turn off the mouse squeaking sound if I need to. All in all, this is one of the best cat toys I've found in years. Hopefully they keep playing with it for a long time to come.",

        "review_comment": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that this is, hands-down, THE BEST cat toy I\u2019ve ever purchased. My cat loves playing hide and seek tag with our hands under blankets, but that can lead to some scratched skin (even though I clip her nails); so, when I saw this, I thought it might be similar, and it is! She is obsessed with it! I\u2019ve had it for about a week and she plays with it for several hours each day. I leave it on standby so she can play with it whenever she wants. I mainly work from home, so I always hear the toy turn on. What\u2019s amazing is that even with it on standby and her playing with it for hours every single day, I\u2019ve only charged it twice. I honestly can\u2019t believe how long the battery lasts. But truly, this is a wonderfully enriching toy for a cat. It engages their hunting skills, keeps them active and enthralled, and I feel like it boosts their intelligence. It\u2019s also amazing for pet owners with young cats who want to play all day. I love playing with her, but since I work from home, I have to get work done too. This allows me to do that. I\u2019m sure it would be even better for people who don\u2019t work from home and literally can\u2019t play with their cat while they work. This toy allows them to activate it whenever they want- they just touch the center part, or jiggle the \u201cmouse\u201d. So, in that way it can prevent your cat from getting bored. Lastly, if you are home to watch, it leads to many laughs. I mean, I literally sit there and watch her play. It\u2019s so amusing! I realize some cats might not respond to it as well as mine, but if your cat likes hunting, feather toys, hide n seek, or playing under the covers, I really think they will love this. A few things to mention: This has a few different modes that you shuffle through by slow pressing the power button. It goes Blue - Purple - Yellow - Off. The blue and purple modes each have 5 min continuous play until they go into standby. The yellow mode has only 30 seconds of play before going into standby. My cat, Bellatrix, mainly likes blue, and while I know blue and purple are slightly different, I don\u2019t know how to describe the difference because they are similar. I think they just have different patterns of movement, or perhaps the purple is faster. Another thing: this does have an optional audible mouse squeezing noise. Bellatrix loves it, but I don\u2019t have it on in the video because my partner is sleeping and I don\u2019t want it to wake him. So, during the day, I leave the squeak on and at night I turn it off. To turn the mouse squeak on or off, press the power button twice quickly- it will blink red when it\u2019s off and green when it\u2019s on. The power button has a silicon cover that lifts up to reveal the usb-c port. This comes with a USB-C to USB-A cord, but no charging brick. It comes with two of the same attachment- plastic rod with the green feather and the green string. I truly can\u2019t recommend this product enough. It\u2019s better than the electronic mice, the electronic balls with feathers, and it\u2019s even better than playing with a feather wand in tunnels. I do my best to give her options, but she prefers this to everything.",

        "review_comment": "I am completely in love with this toy\u2014it has been an absolute game changer for our indoor cats! The activity level has shot up, and both of my cats absolutely love playing with it. It\u2019s a great size, not too big, and it is super lightweight, which makes it easy for them to bat around and for the toy itself to move quickly. The functionality is fantastic; it holds a really good charge, and I love the different stand-by mode options it has, which helps keep the fun going without running down the battery too fast. This toy is constantly on at our house, and it is definitely worth the purchase! We haven't had to worry about ease of cleaning yet since it seems well-made, and the fact that it keeps my cats so active is a huge win. If you have indoor cats, you need this!",

        "review_comment": "The media could not be loaded. Got a crazy feline who full speed runs into walls at all hours and needs at least an hour of play every day? This is amazing for that. I recently adopted my 3rd cat, and she's a tornado of a tortie. She's young, fiesty, and has seemingly endless energy. This keeps her busy for hours, I hear her rustling around with it for at least 2 hours every day. It makes me feel so much better on the busier days when I don't really have time to play with them like I would like to. I like the interactive mode the best, it allows them to come up and play whenever she wants, and then it turns off after some time. I can't lie, it's incredibly ugly and reeks of the late 2000s in terms of pattern, but I'm not buying what I think is cute, I buy what would intrigue a gremlin. It makes a good rustling noise as the fabric is like a reusable grocery bag material. It's pretty big, which also allows my other 2 cats to spectate if they wish. The battery life is very good, I haven't had to charge it since purchasing, and I appreciate how easy it is to charge it. The fake mouse squeaking does get a bit annoying, but I just move it to the other side of my house, and they can keep being annoying over there. Amazing purchase to keep kitties happy",
