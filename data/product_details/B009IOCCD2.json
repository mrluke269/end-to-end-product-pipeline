Jake gets so excited at mealtime, and it\u2019s such a relief to know we\u2019re giving him something that\u2019s both safe and delicious. The price is fantastic for the quality, and we love the convenience of the subscription option\u2014it ensures we never run out, which is a huge plus.

        "review_comment": "I switched my girl to this Purina ONE after her vet suggested trying a chicken and rice formula for her sensitive stomach. She was having some digestive issues with her old food and this has made a huge difference. First thing I noticed is she actually gets excited about meal time now. Before she would kind of pick at her food but with this stuff she cleans her bowl every time. The kibble size seems perfect for her too - not too big, not too small. Her stomach issues cleared up within like two weeks of switching. No more weird digestive problems or upset tummies. She seems way more comfortable after eating now. But the biggest change is her coat. It's gotten so shiny and soft since we started this food. People keep commenting on how healthy she looks. Even her energy level seems better, though that could just be because her stomach feels better. The ingredients look good too - real chicken is the first ingredient and I can actually pronounce most of the stuff on the list. No weird fillers or mystery meat byproducts. Price is reasonable for the quality. Not the cheapest dog food out there but way more affordable than some of the boutique brands that cost twice as much. The bag size lasts a good amount of time even though she's a decent sized dog with a good appetite. Easy to store and the bag seals well to keep it fresh. Only minor complaint is that it can be a little dusty when you pour it, but that's pretty typical for dry kibble. Overall really happy with this food. When you find something that works for your dog's health and they actually like eating it, you stick with it. Definitely buying again when this bag runs out. Makes me feel good knowing she's getting good nutrition without breaking the bank.",
